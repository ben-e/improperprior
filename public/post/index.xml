      <description>IntroductionPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimension reduction technique that is commonly used in the social sciences to build single dimension estimates of socioeconomic status. In this post I will first walk through the intuition and math behind PCA, and then provide a simple example of its use in R to generate a simple asset index.
IntuitionDimension reduction is any process by which we reduce the number of variables in a dataset.</description>

      <description>IntroductionSince I’ve purchased improperprior.com it seems prudent that I write a short post explaining improper priors.
Typical Bayesian ProcessIn Bayesian statistics we exploit Bayes’ theorem to learn something about a population parameter. For example, if we have data \(Y\) that follow a Binomial distribution, and we would like to estimate the \(\theta\) parameter, we would compute:
\[P(\theta|Y) = \frac{L(Y|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(Y)}.\]
In this case:
\(P(\theta|Y)\) is the posterior probability, this is what we’d like to estimate.</description>

      <description>What’s wrong with XLSForms?XLSForm defines a very accessible (other than reliance on Excel) standard for programming surveys compatible with OpenDataKit, SurveyCTO, and a myriad of other data collection tools used in low/no connectivity environments. XLSForm’s are dead easy to program, but can produce very complex surveys. However, in my ~5 years of programming XLSForm surveys I’ve encountered a few problems caused by the reliance on Excel for programming:</description>
