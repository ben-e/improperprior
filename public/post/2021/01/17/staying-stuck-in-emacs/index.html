    <p>I recently saw this post, <a href="https://www.murilopereira.com/the-values-of-emacs-the-neovim-revolution-and-the-vscode-gorilla/">The values of Emacs, the Neovim revolution, and the VSCode gorilla</a>, pop up on HackerNews (<em>I know</em>, it&rsquo;s terrible there), and it really captured why I feel stuck to a degree in Emacs despite the other genuinely good options out there.</p>
<p>For context, I use <a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs">Doom Emacs</a> as my distribution of choice: Evil Mode is great and it&rsquo;s fast. I&rsquo;m also interested in checking out <a href="https://github.com/seagle0128/.emacs.d">Centaur Emacs</a> at some point. I found <a href="https://www.spacemacs.org/">Spacemacs</a> to be customized to an overwhelming degree. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll write more about this at some point, but I found it hard to <em>see</em> Emacs underneath Spacemacs, so to speak. Whereas with Doom, I know it&rsquo;s &ldquo;just&rdquo; setting a bunch of sensible defaults and loading many useful packages. The Doom CLI for updating packages is also very useful.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-centrism">Keyboard Centrism</h2>
<p>Using Emacs means I can almost exclusively use the keyboard in a consistent manner, no matter my task. Honestly the killer feature for me, right now, is how easy writing and testing SQL has become. I can write my query in one buffer, and interact with the results of my query (and my query/result history!) in a SQLi buffer, all using Vim-keys.</p>
<p>[TODO: Gif here?]</p>
<h2 id="text-centrism">Text Centrism</h2>
<p>Because <em>everything</em> in Emacs is just text, it&rsquo;s super easy to pull snippets from one buffer to another, or just out of Emacs to share with a friend. This can be particularly useful when working with Git via <a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a>, which offers far more power than the Git CLI (or maybe I just don&rsquo;t know the CLI as well) while still being text only.</p>
<h2 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h2>
<p>With Emacs it&rsquo;s really easy (once you learn a little elisp, I&rsquo;m still quite reliant on StackOverflow) to add small convenience functions to Emacs on-the-fly. Right now I have a few convenience functions for: encrypting files for a given set of users, connecting to a specified database, opening up new buffers with a specific template. While this is certainly possible in VSCode or Vim, the former requires you set up a whole package and write code in TypeScript or JavaScript, and the latter is actually perfectly capable of doing these things too.</p>
<h2 id="but">But&hellip;</h2>
<p>Emacs is often frustrating. Probably once every three or four months I end up screwing up some package (I still can&rsquo;t figure out why vterm won&rsquo;t load!), it&rsquo;s still pretty easy to get lost among all of the buffers that slowly accumulate (though Centaur&rsquo;s tabs have been a great help here), and it&rsquo;s single threaded nature can lead to very frustrating stutters. While VS Code is often criticized for its memory footprint, Emacs is actually quite large as well (though, I am conflating &ldquo;large&rdquo; in-memory vs. on hard drive).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still quite a novice when it comes to more interesting text editors. I&rsquo;ve spent most of my time in either R Studio or Sublime Text, both of which I love for the things they do really well and dislike for their hard limitations. Emacs doesn&rsquo;t feel like it has these limitations, if only <em>I</em> could figure out how to remove them.</p>
