I am a data scientist, amateur economist, dabbling Bayesian, pretty mediocre cyclist, and an uninspired climber. My academic background includes computer science, economics, and mathematics; my B.A. is from UC Santa Cruz and my M.S. is from Duke University. I am currently interested in R, tidymodels, Bayesian statistics, Rust, and a bunch of other things. I am also a Data Scientist at Teladoc Health.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Hi!
