      <description>Note: I wrote this post mostly for my Facebook page, which I regrettably still maintain. As such, there are references to posts I have seen from family and friends which may not entirely make sense in the context of this blog.
I basically don&#39;t post anything on social media anymore, but at this point it feels irresponsible not to (it is also the absolute least I can do). Unequivocally: Black Lives Matter.</description>

      <description>What is TripleByte?TripleByte aims to simplify the hiring process for candidates and companies by conducting background-blind interviews to certify candidates (seriously, you can get a certificate) based solely on their skills. The TripleByte process is meant to replace every interview except the final round, in theory easing the burden on job-seekers, who need only prepare for a single standardized interview (plus the final round), and speeding up the hiring process for companies.</description>
