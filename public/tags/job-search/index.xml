      <description>What is TripleByte? TripleByte aims to simplify the hiring process for candidates and companies by conducting background-blind interviews to certify candidates (seriously, you can get a certificate) based solely on their skills. The TripleByte process is meant to replace every interview except the final round, in theory easing the burden on job-seekers, who need only prepare for a single standardized interview (plus the final round), and speeding up the hiring process for companies.</description>
