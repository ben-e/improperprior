      <description>What is TripleByte?TripleByte aims to simplify the hiring process for candidates and companies by conducting background-blind interviews to certify candidates (seriously, you can get a certificate) based solely on their skills. The TripleByte process is meant to replace every interview except the final round, in theory easing the burden on job-seekers, who need only prepare for a single standardized interview (plus the final round), and speeding up the hiring process for companies.</description>

      <description>IntroductionIâ€™ve seen a number of articles/posts pop up around the internet with lists of data science interview questions. I thought it might be a good exercise in communication and data science knowledge to answer these questions. I am finding it harder than I would have expected to write good (and hopefully useful) answers!
Question sources:
HackerNoon - 160+ Data Science Interview QuestionsAdditional resources:
Alexey Grigorev has put together a whole GitHub repo with data science interview questions and answers, available here.</description>
