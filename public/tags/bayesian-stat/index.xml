      <description>These are my goals for the coming year. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to make each actionable, with a rough plan, time estimate, and an end goal. The end goals are all something to be built, not something to be necessarily finished. The &amp;ldquo;How&amp;rdquo; section of each of these goals may list a particular book or tutorials, but I want to be clear that the goal is not finishing these, but to use them to accomplish the goal.</description>

      <description>IntroductionSince I’ve purchased improperprior.com it seems prudent that I write a short post explaining improper priors.
Typical Bayesian ProcessIn Bayesian statistics we exploit Bayes’ theorem to learn something about a population parameter. For example, if we have data \(Y\) that follow a Binomial distribution, and we would like to estimate the \(\theta\) parameter, we would compute:
\[P(\theta|Y) = \frac{L(Y|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(Y)}.\]
In this case:
\(P(\theta|Y)\) is the posterior probability, this is what we’d like to estimate.</description>
