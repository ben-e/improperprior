      <description>IntroductionSince I’ve purchased improperprior.com it seems prudent that I write a short post explaining improper priors.
Typical Bayesian ProcessIn Bayesian statistics we exploit Bayes’ theorem to learn something about a population parameter. For example, if we have data \(Y\) that follow a Binomial distribution, and we would like to estimate the \(\theta\) parameter, we would compute:
\[P(\theta|Y) = \frac{L(Y|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(Y)}.\]
In this case:
\(P(\theta|Y)\) is the posterior probability, this is what we’d like to estimate.</description>
