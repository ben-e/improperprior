      <description>IntroductionPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimension reduction technique that is commonly used in the social sciences to build single dimension estimates of socioeconomic status. In this post I will first walk through the intuition and math behind PCA, and then provide a simple example of its use in R to generate a simple asset index.
IntuitionDimension reduction is any process by which we reduce the number of variables in a dataset.</description>

      <description>IntroductionSince I’ve purchased improperprior.com it seems prudent that I write a short post explaining improper priors.
Typical Bayesian ProcessIn Bayesian statistics we exploit Bayes’ theorem to learn something about a population parameter. For example, if we have data \(Y\) that follow a Binomial distribution, and we would like to estimate the \(\theta\) parameter, we would compute:
\[P(\theta|Y) = \frac{L(Y|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(Y)}.\]
In this case:
\(P(\theta|Y)\) is the posterior probability, this is what we’d like to estimate.</description>

      <description>What’s wrong with XLSForms?XLSForm defines a very accessible (other than reliance on Excel) standard for programming surveys compatible with OpenDataKit, SurveyCTO, and a myriad of other data collection tools used in low/no connectivity environments. XLSForm’s are dead easy to program, but can produce very complex surveys. However, in my ~5 years of programming XLSForm surveys I’ve encountered a few problems caused by the reliance on Excel for programming:</description>

      <description>I am currently a graduate student at Duke University pursuing a M.S. in Economics and Computation. I enjoy climbing, cycling, and running, as well as hacking on interesting problems (usually in R). I have worked previously in various data science roles and I am currently searching for opportunities following my graduation in May 2020. My resume can be found here.</description>

      <description>These are some things I like:
BlogsGordon Shotwell’s Data Science Blog - I stumbled on Gordon’s blog because of a HackerNews post. I have so far found all of his posts to be very insightful and well thought out.Eric’s Movie Blog - This is a movie blog run by a friend from undergraduate. His movie reviews are extremely well written.Craig Gidney’s Algorithmic Assertions - This is a fantastic math/computer science blog.</description>
