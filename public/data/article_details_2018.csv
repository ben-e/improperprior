0,Minimum Wage and Outward FDI from China,"['Fan, Haichao', 'Lin, Faqin', 'Tang, Lixin']","We construct a comprehensive manufacturing firm-level dataset to study the effects of minimum wage increase in China on firms’ probability of conducting outward foreign direct investment (outward FDI). Our baseline results show that the increase in minimum wage can explain about 32.3% of the growth in outward FDI from China over 2001–2012. We use three different strategies to address potential endogeneity concerns. First, we control for a number of local macroeconomic variables. Second, to rule out spatially-correlated confounding factors, we employ a regression design based on bordering cities across provincial borders. Lastly, we conduct a placebo test by studying the effects of minimum wage increase on FDI to tax-haven destinations. We then examine the heterogeneous effects of minimum wage increase. We find the effects on outward FDI to be stronger for more productive firms, those with foreign ownership, those in the more labor-intensive sectors, those located in the coastal region, for the years after 2004 and for production-oriented FDI projects.",41,3,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:135:y:2018:i:c:p:1-19,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.06.013,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v135y2018icp1-19.html,2020-03-09 19:07:24," 2018, Volume 135, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html
1,Improving or disappearing: Firm-level adjustments to minimum wages in China,"['Mayneris, Florian', 'Poncet, Sandra', 'Zhang, Tao']","We here consider how Chinese firms react to higher minimum wages, exploiting the 2004 minimum-wage Reform in China. After this reform, we find that the wage costs for surviving firms that were more exposed to minimum-wage hikes rose, but also that their productivity significantly improved, allowing them to absorb the cost shock without any change in their profitability and with limited job losses. Our results are robust to pre-existing trend analysis and an IV strategy. However, the survival probability of the firms that were most exposed to minimum-wage hikes fell after the Reform. Firm-level productivity gains partly came from better inventory management and greater investment in capital, at the cost of a reduction in firm-level cash.",56,3,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:135:y:2018:i:c:p:20-42,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.06.010,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v135y2018icp20-42.html,2020-03-09 19:07:27," 2018, Volume 135, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html
2,Mobile money and risk sharing against village shocks,"['Riley, Emma']","Households in developing countries have gained increased access to remittances through the recent introduction of mobile money services. I examine the impact of these mobile money services on consumption after a rainfall shock, such as a flood or drought, for both users of mobile money and for household that don't use mobile money but who reside in villages with other users. This allows me to determine the extent that remittances received via mobile money are shared within villages, creating wider benefits to the community. Using a difference-in-difference fixed effects specification, I find that after a village-level rainfall shock it is only users of mobile money who are able to prevent a drop in their consumption. There are no spillover effects to other members of the village. This finding has implications for how new technologies might change traditional risk sharing arrangements, and who might benefit and lose out from their spread.",16,3,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:135:y:2018:i:c:p:43-58,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.06.015,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v135y2018icp43-58.html,2020-03-09 19:07:31," 2018, Volume 135, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html
3,Quality and the Great Trade Collapse,"['Chen, Natalie', 'Juvenal, Luciana']","We investigate theoretically and empirically the heterogeneous effects of the global financial crisis on international trade flows differentiated by quality. Our model, which identifies the effect of quality on trade that arises on the demand side, through the relationship between income and quality choice, predicts that a negative income shock disproportionately reduces the demand for higher relative to lower quality traded goods (a “flight from quality”). Using a unique dataset of firm-level wine exports for an emerging market economy, Argentina, combined with experts wine ratings as a measure of quality, we find strong evidence of a flight from quality as we show that the values, volumes, unit values, and markups of higher quality exports contracted more sharply during the crisis.

We define a “trembling trade” as a situation in which gains from trade are overtaken by losses of relative income, with the result that global social welfare is reduced. A constructive example reveals that a “trembling trade” can arise even when trade is doubly gainful in that it increases the income of every individual and narrows the income gap between the trading populations.",36,0,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:135:y:2018:i:c:p:77-84,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.03.004,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v135y2018icp77-84.html,2020-03-09 19:07:38," 2018, Volume 135, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

We examine Beijing's license plate lottery system, which began in 2011 and restricts the number of new and used vehicles people can obtain. Leveraging a randomized survey, we show that one unintended consequence of the vehicle restrictions has been to reduce the number of births in the households of lottery entrants between 2011 and 2014. The vehicle restrictions reduce births in households of lottery participants by 35 percent, implying a remarkable 6 percent reduction in births across the entire city.

In this paper, we estimate the effects of racial quotas at the University of Brasilia, which reserved 20% of admissions slots for persons who self-identified as black. To do so, we link the admissions outcomes of high-performing applicants in 2004–2005 to their education and labor market outcomes in 2012. We adopt methods that make use of sharp discontinuities in the admissions process. In summary, the policy of racial quotas mostly improved outcomes for the targeted group. Quota applicants, specifically males, enjoyed an increase in years of education, college completion, and labor earnings. More broadly, the results for quota and non-quota applicants confirm the importance of college quality in a setting outside of the U.S.",31,1,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:135:y:2018:i:c:p:97-116,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.06.017,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v135y2018icp97-116.html,2020-03-09 19:07:46," 2018, Volume 135, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

We build a simple theoretical model showing that trade integration of input markets entails energy efficiency improvements within importers relative to non-importers. To empirically isolate the impact of firm participation in foreign intermediate input markets we use ‘nearest neighbour’ propensity score matching and difference-in-difference techniques.

8,"Women's schooling, fertility, and child health outcomes: Evidence from Uganda's free primary education program","['Keats, Anthony']","This paper examines the role of women's education on both fertility and child health in Uganda. To identify causal effects, I exploit the timing of a national reform that eliminated primary school fees in 1997 to implement a regression discontinuity design. At the cutoff, the reform increased educational attainment by nearly one year on average, with impacts across all grade levels through the end of secondary school. Women with more schooling both delay and reduce overall fertility, increase early child health investments, and have less chronically malnourished children. In terms of mechanisms, women with additional schooling do not abstain more from sex as adolescents, but they are more likely to have used contraceptives before a first pregnancy and they delay marriage. Other downstream effects include improved employment outcomes and greater wealth.",32,6,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:135:y:2018:i:c:p:142-159,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.07.002,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v135y2018icp142-159.html,2020-03-09 19:07:53," 2018, Volume 135, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

After two seasons, households who received the technology were 10 percentage points more likely to plant hybrid maize varieties that are more susceptible to insect pests in storage than traditional lower-yielding varieties. Treated smallholders also stored maize for a longer period, reported a substantial drop in storage losses, and were less likely to use storage chemicals than untreated cohorts.

11,Measuring heterogeneity in preferences over the sex of children,"['Norling, Johannes']","This paper introduces a model-based approach for measuring heterogeneity in sex preferences using birth history records. The approach identifies the combinations of preferences over the sex and number of children that best explain observed childbearing. Empirical estimates indicate that a majority of parents in Africa, Asia, and the Americas consider the sex of children when making childbearing decisions. Many parents prefer sons and many prefer daughters. Comparisons with reported preferences suggest that survey respondents tend to underreport the degree to which they prefer sons or daughters. Estimates indicate that, although sex preferences are widespread, they have little effect on aggregate fertility levels.",13,1,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:135:y:2018:i:c:p:199-221,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.07.004,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v135y2018icp199-221.html,2020-03-09 19:08:04," 2018, Volume 135, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html
12,Beyond the Quantity–Quality tradeoff: Population control policy and human capital investment,"['Wang, Xuebo', 'Zhang, Junsen']","The quantity–quality tradeoff theory implies that a reduction in fertility would induce more human capital investment per child, and it is widely believed that population control policy could promote human capital levels in developing countries. China's one-child policy (OCP) has significantly reduced the fertility in the country, and popular belief holds that this policy has contributed to the enhancement in China's human capital since 1979. However, the quantity–quality tradeoff dose not present the complete truth—another crucial factor relates to which segment of the population is reduced, a critical issue that has been ignored in the literature. China's OCP is significantly more strictly implemented in urban areas than in rural areas, where human capital investment in children is significantly lower. This two-tier OCP could have significantly increased the rural–urban fertility ratio and brought about important consequences. We first emphasize the importance of such a population compositional effect, which may offset the potentially positive quantity–quality tradeoff effect on human capital. We present a simple analytic framework and quantify the relative sizes of the quantity–quality tradeoff and compositional effects. We find that the former is dominated by the latter, and that the OCP has reduced the average human capital level of China's next generation by approximately 1–2%. This novel evidence indicates that the conventional wisdom on population control may be incomplete and that its policy implications could be misleading.",17,0,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:135:y:2018:i:c:p:222-234,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.04.007,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v135y2018icp222-234.html,2020-03-09 19:08:08," 2018, Volume 135, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html
13,Subsidies versus mental accounting nudges: Harnessing mobile payment systems to improve sanitation,"['Lipscomb, Molly', 'Schechter, Laura']","The proliferation of mobile money across developing countries has led to an increase in availability of mobile payment systems. This decreases the organizational complexity of allowing more flexible payment terms for customers. We test whether subsidies, deposit requirements, and access to a mobile money savings vehicle increase the propensity of households to purchase an improved but more expensive sanitation service. While high subsidies increase purchases of the improved service, interventions inspired by mental accounting such as deposit requirements and earmarked savings accounts do not. The option to save in earmarked accounts using mobile money caused households to substitute away from purchasing the improved service in the general market and towards purchasing it through our providers, rather than substituting away from the unimproved service. We discuss implications for mental accounting-based policies compared to more traditional subsidies.",20,2,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:135:y:2018:i:c:p:235-254,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.07.007,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v135y2018icp235-254.html,2020-03-09 19:08:11," 2018, Volume 135, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html
14,Worth fighting for: Daughters improve their mothers' autonomy in South Asia,"['Heath, Rachel', 'Tan, Xu']","In South Asia, parents prize sons for both economic and cultural reasons, and having a son is often thought to improve his mother's status within the household. However, using data from Bangladesh and India, we show that such high regard does not necessarily translate into improved autonomy for her. In fact, a daughter raises her mother's participation in household decisions and her freedom of mobility relative to a son. A daughter also prompts her mother to work more, but not necessarily to consume more. These effects are strongest among mothers of older girls. These results are consistent with a theoretical model in which mothers have greater relative preferences for spending on their daughters than fathers do, and so seek more autonomy to direct resources to their daughters.",41,0,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:135:y:2018:i:c:p:255-271,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.07.003,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v135y2018icp255-271.html,2020-03-09 19:08:15," 2018, Volume 135, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

This paper introduces an econometric strategy for estimating individual or household-level development resilience from panel data. Estimation of multiple conditional moments of a welfare function—itself specified to permit potentially nonlinear path dynamics—enables the computation and forecasting of individual-specific conditional probabilities of satisfying a normative minimum standard of living. We then develop a decomposable resilience measure that enables aggregation of the individual-specific estimates to targetable subpopulation- and population-level measures.

We construct a novel fully geocoded dataset that combines contemporary individual-level data with historical information on missionary activities.

This math gender gap has been documented to vary across countries, and shown to grow as students advance through school. In this paper I suggest that these patterns may be explained by sample selection caused by gender differences in schooling's opportunity costs, which lead lower-achieving males to drop out. I present and test the implications of a labor supply model that examines the opportunity cost of school attendance and, thereby, the observed math gender gap. Using an exogenous policy change, the launch of a conditional cash transfer program in Colombia, I estimate that sample selection explains between 50 percent and 60 percent of the gap.

To examine the role of offshoring and technological change in driving this labor market development, we develop a task-based model of production in global value chains and propose a decomposition of changes in occupational labor demand. In the setup of the model, technological change affects the total number of workers with a certain occupation throughout the production chain, while task relocation consists of a shift in occupational labor demand from one location to another.

23,The impact of U.S. deportation of criminals on gang development and education in El Salvador,"['Kalsi, Priti']","This paper links American criminal deportations with gang activity and reduced schooling in El Salvador. Regions with greater business density before the deportations are argued to be suitable for future gangs, as extortion of businesses is their primary source of income. These regions are shown to become disproportionately more violent with more criminal deportations. Using variation in time and location, I estimate a difference-in-differences model to study the impact of gang exposure on children's education. Gangs hinder basic education (comparable to U.S. grades 1–9), with boys experiencing a greater loss in schooling. I reject the threat of a pre-existing trend and selective migration in high business density areas. The results do not appear to be explained by violence alone, but by a weakening economy in gang-prone areas that could have lowered the returns to schooling. Boys' involvement in gangs and increased employment could explain their larger loss of schooling.",13,0,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:135:y:2018:i:c:p:433-448,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.08.010,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v135y2018icp433-448.html,2020-03-09 19:08:48," 2018, Volume 135, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

Variation in inheritance by widows is based on customary village practices, which we observe in surveys of village leaders.

This result is robust to several checks, notably to the instrumentation of aid and to estimations on various sub-samples and on an extended cross-section sample of 93 countries.

To do this, I exploit variation in the implementation of seat quotas for women applied to a three-tiered local governance structure in India. Enrollment effects were substantially larger than those previously estimated for exposure to female leaders in the lowest tier of local government. The policy response is larger among girls in poorer households and those with less-educated women in the household, and was commensurate with reductions in idle time and employment in household enterprises. There is no evidence of additional school infrastructure, nor a reallocation of schooling resources.

We examine the long-term impact of Mexico's 16th-century demographic collapse on landholding patterns through the present day. We show that the collapse, which reduced the indigenous population by between 70 and 90 percent and differed in severity across space, facilitated land concentration and the rise of a landowner class that dominated Mexican political economy for centuries. To identify the impact of the population collapse on land arrangements we use an instrumental-variables identification strategy exploiting climatic shocks associated with an epidemic in the 1570s that roughly halved the indigenous population. Though landholding patterns were transformed following the Revolution of 1910, we also show that disease-impacted areas now have more land in common-property institutions with limited property rights.

Households with higher education adopt accounts and experience rises in savings and income, while low education households do not. However, the benefits to adopters are used to help insure the rest of the village – in contrast to suggestions elsewhere in the literature that savings may negatively impact sharing through networks. Non-savers experience large rises in transfer receipts, improved food consumption, and better health. The worst-off households experience particularly strong increases in informal aid.

The model generates a rich set of predictions including productivity cut-offs for formal and informal firms to operate within different industries. We allow fixed costs to vary across industries, resulting in overlapping productivity distributions between formal and informal firms in the aggregate, but strict duality within industries. In doing so, we are able to generate and test predictions with regard to heterogeneity in informality across industries for the case of Indian manufacturing establishments. Consistent with the model, we find that the overlap between formal and informal establishments in the aggregate is larger than the overlaps within industries.

In Brazil, wage inequality has steadily declined since the early 1990s. Counterfactual exercises show that the evolutions of the schooling and experience premiums are key determinants of the decline in inequality. The 2000s witnessed a rapid decline in the schooling and experience premiums, at the same time as the working population was aging and becoming more educated. To understand these changes, the paper develops a model of imperfect substitution across experience and education groups and estimates the relevant elasticities of substitution. Changes in labor supply contributed significantly to the decline of the experience and education premiums, but are not enough to account fully for the observed changes.

In addition to permanent damages to public and private capital, the disaster causes temporary losses of productivity, inefficiencies during the reconstruction process, and damages to the sovereign's creditworthiness. We use the model to study the debt sustainability concerns that arise from the need to fully rebuild public infrastructure over the medium term and analyze the feasibility of ex ante policies, such as building adaptation infrastructure and fiscal buffers, and contrast these policies with the post-disaster support provided by donors. Investing in resilient infrastructure may prove useful, in particular if it is viewed as complementary to standard infrastructure, because it raises the marginal product of private capital, crowding in private investment, while helping withstand the impact of the natural disaster. In an application to Vanuatu, we find that donors should provide an additional 50% of pre-cyclone GDP in grants to be spent over the following 15 years to ensure public debt remains sustainable following Cyclone Pam.

33,Heterogeneous effects of economic integration agreements,"['Baier, Scott L.', 'Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.', 'Clance, Matthew W.']","It is now widely accepted that economic integration agreements (EIAs) and other trade-policy liberalizations contribute to nations' economic growth and development and help alleviate poverty. However, the economic effects of such policies vary across countries' economic structures; for instance, developing countries face higher fixed trade costs (partly due to higher government border-crossing costs and weaker port infrastructures). We offer three potential contributions. First, we extend a standard Melitz general equilibrium trade model with firm heterogeneity to show how variable-cost and fixed-cost “trade elasticities” associated with trade liberalizations are heterogeneous and endogenous to levels of country-pairs' bilateral policy and non-policy, variable and fixed trade costs – even allowing for CES preferences and an untruncated Pareto distribution of productivities. Using associated comparative statics, we provide several explicit predictions of the heterogeneous (variable- and fixed-cost) bilateral extensive-margin, intensive-margin, and trade elasticities. Second, we provide empirical support for the theoretical hypotheses. Trade elasticities vary across particular settings. Third, we demonstrate the relevance of these theoretical and empirical results for ex ante trade-flow predictions of potential EIAs. For instance, we show that a 10 percent lower average per capita income of a country-pair is associated with a 60 percent higher partial EIA effect. Moreover, we show empirically that 95–99 percent of the welfare (or probability) estimates of EIA liberalizations between 1,358 North-North, North-South, and South-South country-pairs can be explained by our heterogeneous EIA partial treatment effects.",50,5,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:135:y:2018:i:c:p:587-608,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.08.014,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v135y2018icp587-608.html,2020-03-09 19:09:25," 2018, Volume 135, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

Allende's election and subsequent socialist experiment decreased share values, while the military coup and dictatorship that replaced him boosted them, in both cases by magnitudes unprecedented in the literature.

We find that reducing average outage levels to those of South Africa would increase overall sales of firms in Sub-Saharan Africa by 85.1%, rising to 117.4% for firms without a generator.",23,1,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:134:y:2018:i:c:p:150-159,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.05.003,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v134y2018icp150-159.html,2020-03-09 19:10:02," 2018, Volume 134, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

In this article, I examine the effect of a reduction of foreign tariffs on the productivity of supplier industries of exporters. Using a panel of Chilean plants during a period of trade liberalization with the European Union, the United States, and the Republic of Korea, I show that the average reduction in the foreign tariff faced by downstream industries (1.1 percentage points) increases the productivity of intermediate input suppliers industries by 1.5 percent. The increase in productivity among supplier industries accounts for 22.5 percent of aggregate productivity gains. I find that tariff cuts induce firms to acquire new machinery and pay higher wages to skilled workers.

The Italian migration was negatively selected at the national level, but positively selected at the local level. Selection varied systematically within Italy, with more positive local selection from shorter and poorer provinces. Selection was more negative among individuals with stronger connections in the United States and became more positive after imposition of the literacy test in 1917.

This paper explores an additional challenge, for monetary policy. Although remittances expand bank balance sheets, providing a stable flow of interest-insensitive funding, they tend to increase banks' holdings of liquid assets. This both reduces the need for an interbank market and severs the link between policy rate and banks’ marginal cost of funds, thus shutting down a major transmission channel. We develop a stylized model based on asymmetric information and a lack of transparent borrowers and undertake econometric analysis providing evidence that increased remittance inflows are associated with weaker transmission. As independent monetary policy becomes impaired, this result is consistent with earlier findings that recipient countries tend to favor fixed exchange rate regimes.",43,4,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:134:y:2018:i:c:p:272-288,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.05.013,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v134y2018icp272-288.html,2020-03-09 19:10:27," 2018, Volume 134, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

External shocks account for a small share of the variance of GDP, especially at short horizons. However, their relative contribution has risen in recent decades, as the incidence of domestic shocks has declined. Global monetary shocks have become the leading external source of GDP volatility in developing countries. At short horizons, real and financial openness raise the share of volatility attributable to external shocks. At longer horizons, financial openness helps reduce the volatility contribution of global real shocks, but not that of global monetary shocks, thus augmenting the relative role of the latter.

By creating resentment against the religious minorities, this occupational pattern strengthens the diffusion of the majority religion in the population. An economic prohibition is then instigated by the clerics in the majority religion, because it allows them to consolidate their norms and to increase the scope of their control over popular masses.

Even if household consumption sharing is efficient, labor choices are no longer efficient. Using data on Malawi, where there is predetermined variation in land rights that determine outside options in marriage, I show that individuals spend more time on agricultural labor and less time on wage labor when household land is theirs.

We show that, during municipal election years, the government increases the overall amount of transfers to municipalities (local governments), and that these additional resources are allocated to the politically aligned mayors.

Calibrating the model to yield a long-run equilibrium consistent with sample averages for 56 developing countries for the period 1990–2014, we show that the effect of remittances depends critically on how they impinge on the recipient economy, i.e., whether these inflows are (i) permanent or temporary, (ii) associated with a collateral effect to securitize borrowing, and (iii) exogenous or countercyclical. We also identify the conditions under which remittances are associated with an expansion of the informal sector, as well as the Dutch Disease effect.",52,2,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:133:y:2018:i:c:p:66-83,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.02.002,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v133y2018icp66-83.html,2020-03-09 19:11:22," 2018, Volume 133, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

In late 2005, the Chinese central government made cutting sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions the main performance evaluation criterion for prefectural city mayors and Party secretaries. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we find that the performance evaluation system caused a significant decrease in SO2 emissions, as well as in the GDP growth rate. Our mechanism analyses further corroborate that local bureaucrats in Two Control Zone cities were willing to trade off GDP growth to achieve the more stringent emissions reductions goal.

Household hours account on average for nearly half of the total hours worked in the household and the market. The vast majority of household hours produce services. As GDP per capita increases, average total hours worked and average household hours per working–age population decrease while average market hours increase (“marketization”); hours producing services increase their share in total hours (“structural transformation”). The decrease in household hours is mostly due to changes in housework (cleaning, cooking etc.) and marketization is mostly due to changes in women's hours. Within countries, more educated people work more in the market and less in the household. We also impute the labor productivity of household production for 34 countries of our sample.

Evidence from two experiments in rural Bihar,"['Banerjee, Abhijit', 'Barnhardt, Sharon', 'Duflo, Esther']","Iron deficiency anemia is frequent among the poor worldwide. While it can be prevented with the appropriate supplement or food fortification, these programs struggle to reach the poorest, out-of-school children, men and the elderly. This paper reports on the impact of a potential strategy to address iron deficiency anemia in rural areas: salt fortified with iron and iodine (DFS). We conduct a large-scale experiment in 400 villages in Bihar to test the impacts of both selling DFS and giving it away for free. At baseline, 45% of the sample is anemic. In 200 randomly assigned villages, we introduce DFS for the first time at half the normal retail price and sell it for roughly 30 months. In 62 of those sales villages, we deliver DFS for free directly to 7 randomly assigned households over nearly 24 months. We find no evidence that either selling DFS or providing it for free has an economically meaningful or statistically significant impact on hemoglobin, anemia, physical health, cognition or mental health. For the sales experiment, we can reject a reduction of 2.4 percent in the fraction anemic in the entire sample and 1 percent among those who were previously anemic. Using an IV strategy, we find a statistically significant, though relatively small, increase in hemoglobin and reduction in the fraction anemic for adolescents, a subgroup that responded well to supplements and fortification in earlier studies. These disappointing results are explained both by modest purchases and low impact of DFS for the majority of the population, even when consumed somewhat regularly.",11,5,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:133:y:2018:i:c:p:127-146,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2017.12.004,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v133y2018icp127-146.html,2020-03-09 19:11:33," 2018, Volume 133, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

After implementing a social network census, one of three village-level treatments determined which treated nodes in the village received information about composting: random assignment, nodes with the highest degree, or nodes with high betweenness. We then look at how information diffuses through the network. We find information diffusion declines with social distance, suggesting frictions in the diffusion of information. Aggregate knowledge about the technology did not differ across targeting strategies, but targeting nodes using betweenness measures in village-level networks excludes less-connected nodes from new information. Women farmers are less likely to receive information when betweenness centrality is used in targeting, suggesting there are important gender differences, not only in the relationship between social distance and diffusion, but also in the social learning process.",16,7,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:133:y:2018:i:c:p:147-161,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.01.009,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v133y2018icp147-161.html,2020-03-09 19:11:36," 2018, Volume 133, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

Firms have two alternative means to increase work effort: discipline and control vs. monetary incentives. A key ingredient of our model lies in the fact that workers suffer from present-bias. We show that this lack of self-control makes discipline relatively cheap when workers' outside option is low even in the absence of moral hazard. Then, as one economy develops, it endogenously goes through three stages where firms successively use low-powered monetary incentives, factory discipline and then high-powered monetary incentives.

This paper develops a New Keynesian small open economy model to show, analytically and numerically, that several prevalent features of LICs—dependence on external financing, public investment inefficiency, and a low degree of home bias in public investment—play important roles in government spending effects. External financing increases the resource envelope, mitigating the crowding out effects, but it tends to appreciate the real exchange rate, lowering traded output. Although capital scarcity in LICs implies high returns to public capital, low marginal investment efficiency can substantially dampen the output multiplier. Also, public investment may not be effective in stimulating output in the short run, as LICs often rely on imports to a large extent to carry out public investment projects, weakening its role as a short-run demand stimulus.",58,11,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:133:y:2018:i:c:p:201-219,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.02.005,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v133y2018icp201-219.html,2020-03-09 19:11:47," 2018, Volume 133, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

Empirically, we run an error-correction investment model for U.S. Compustat and Chinese manufacturing firms, and for various sub-samples of the Chinese firms. Our estimates on investment-cash flow sensitivities imply a 5% and 15% total factor productivity loss respectively for the balanced and unbalanced panels of Chinese firms.

We use population censuses and large-scale household surveys to compile detailed data on the ethnolinguistic composition of each region and match all reported ethnicities to Ethnologue, a comprehensive catalog of world languages. This matching allows us to standardize the notion of an ethnolinguistic group and account for relatedness between language pairs, a correlate of shared history and culture, when calculating diversity indices. Exploiting within-country variation provided by our new dataset, we find that local public goods provision, as reflected in metrics of education, health, and electricity access, is negatively related to ethnolinguistic diversity, but only if the underlying basic languages are first aggregated into larger families or if linguistic distances between groups are taken into consideration. In other words, only deep-rooted diversity, based on cleavages formed in the distant past, is strongly inversely associated with a range of regional development indicators.

Our findings show that import competition induced plants in Mexico to increase energy efficiency, reduce emissions, and in turn reduce direct investment in environmental protection.

87,Agricultural reforms and production in China: Changes in provincial production function and productivity in 1978–2015,"['Gong, Binlei']","A series of fundamental and market-oriented reforms since 1978 have dramatically reshaped China's agricultural sector, which had been sluggish during the socialist period. Besides productivity growth and efficiency changes, the shape of the production function may also transform rapidly over time. Moreover, the four segments in agriculture (farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries) have different production processes and techniques, so the aggregated production function of agriculture may vary across provinces. Compared with existing studies, which usually assume a fixed production function, this paper allows a varying coefficient production function that can better capture the structure change in the six reform periods over the past four decades. The empirical results show that the labor elasticity is decreasing, the fertilizer and machinery elasticities are increasing, and the land elasticity has a U-shaped curve across time. Moreover, technology and inputs are leading the growth alternatively in different reform periods.",53,6,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:132:y:2018:i:c:p:18-31,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2017.12.005,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v132y2018icp18-31.html,2020-03-09 19:12:42," 2018, Volume 132, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html
88,Trading frictions in Indian village economies,"['Emerick, Kyle']","This paper presents evidence of trading frictions in rural Indian villages. I first introduced a new seed variety to a random subset of farmers in 82 villages. I then allowed the new variety to diffuse through farmer-to-farmer trading in a random half of villages. This mode of exchange is compared with demand that was approximated by selling the same seeds directly to farmers in the other half of villages. I find that direct trading between farmers leads to substantial under-adoption when compared to door-to-door sales — suggesting that trading frictions exist and represent a barrier to technological diffusion. Caste identity explains some, but not all, of this puzzle. Specifically, farmers sharing the same surname or belonging to the same subcaste as the original seed recipients adopt at higher rates when farmers trade amongst themselves. Overall, the trading frictions in farmer-to-farmer exchange are severe enough to make door-to-door sales cost effective.",21,0,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:132:y:2018:i:c:p:32-56,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2017.12.010,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v132y2018icp32-56.html,2020-03-09 19:12:46," 2018, Volume 132, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

We examine the link between land demarcation and investment in rural Benin in light of a model of agricultural production under insecure tenure. The demarcation process involved communities in the mapping and attribution of land rights; cornerstones marked parcel boundaries and offered lasting landmarks. The tenure security improvement through demarcation induces a 23 to 43 percent shift toward long-term investment on treated parcels. We explore gender and parcel location as relevant dimensions of heterogeneity. We find that female-managed landholdings in treated villages are more likely to be left fallow—an important soil fertility investment.

We exploit the variation in exposure to competition from China, following its accession to the WTO in 2001, across Mexican municipalities and estimate the effect of international competition on the individual decision to migrate. Controlling for individual and municipality features, we find that individuals living in municipalities more exposed to Chinese import competition are more likely to migrate to other municipalities within Mexico, while a negative effect is found on the decision to migrate to the US. In particular, we find that Chinese import competition reduces migrants' negative self-selection: the rising international competition lowers the likelihood of low-educated, low-income people to migrate to the US, by making them more financially constrained.

This inverted U-shaped, cross-sectional relationship between emigration and development was first hypothesized by Zelinsky's theory of the mobility transition. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the upward segment of the curve (the most common being the existence of financial constraints), they have not been examined in a systematic way. In this paper, we propose two decomposition methods to disentangle the main drivers of the mobility transition curve to OECD destination countries. Our simple decompositions shed light on the role of both microeconomic drivers (i.e., financial incentives and constraints) and macroeconomic drivers, as well as the skill composition of the population. Our double decomposition further distinguishes between migration aspirations and realization rates by education level. Overall, we provide consistent evidence that the role of financial constraints, while relevant for the poorest countries, is limited. Rather, a large fraction of the increasing segment is explained by the skill composition and by macroeconomic drivers (i.e., by factors that do not change in the short-run).",37,14,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:132:y:2018:i:c:p:88-101,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2017.12.003,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v132y2018icp88-101.html,2020-03-09 19:12:57," 2018, Volume 132, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

This paper fills this gap by exploring to what extent concentration of a country's non-resource export basket is determined by their exports of natural resources. We present a theoretical framework that shows how upward pressure in wages caused by a resource windfall results in higher export concentration. We then document two robust empirical findings consistent with the theory. First, using data on discovery of oil and gas fields and of commodity prices as sources of exogenous variation, we find that countries with larger shares of natural resources in exports have more concentrated non-resource export baskets.

In a field experiment in rural Malawi, we hired casual day laborers at piece rates and collected detailed data on the quantity and quality of their output. Specifically, we use a simplified Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism, which provides random variation in piece rates conditional on revealed reservation rates, to separately identify the effects of worker selection and incentives on output. We find a positive relationship between output quantity and the piece rate, and show that this is solely the result of the incentive effect, not selection. In addition, we randomized whether workers were subject to stringent quality monitoring. Monitoring led to higher quality output, at some cost to the quantity produced. However, workers do not demand higher compensation when monitored, and monitoring has no measurable effect on the quality of workers willing to work under a given piece rate.

To do the analysis, I calibrate and simulate a two-sector, neoclassical growth model to match the data and perform the policy experiments. I find that agricultural imports played a crucial role in the early transformation of Great Britain, while, in South Korea, trade also had a positive impact on its structural transformation but it could have played a much larger role if the country had not introduced agricultural protection policies.",36,28,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:130:y:2018:i:c:p:45-65,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2017.09.002,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v130y2018icp45-65.html,2020-03-09 19:13:59," 2018, Volume 130, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

The nighttime lights estimates show that refugee inflows increase economic activity in areas very close to Kakuma refugee camp: the elasticity of the luminosity index to refugee population is 0.36 within a 10 km distance from the camp center. In addition, household consumption within the same proximity to the camp is 25% higher than in areas farther away.

110,Land productivity and plot size: Is measurement error driving the inverse relationship?,"['Desiere, Sam', 'Jolliffe, Dean']","This paper revisits the decades-old puzzle of the inverse plot-size productivity relationship (IR), which states that land productivity decreases as plot size increases. While existing studies define land productivity or yields as self-reported production divided by plot size, we consider an alternative approach to estimating yields based on crop cuts. The crop-cut method entails measuring and harvesting randomly selected subplots by trained technicians, and is recommended by the Food and Agricultural Organization for the accurate measurement of crop production. Using data of rural Ethiopia, our analysis indicates that the IR is strong when based on self-reported production, but disappears when based on crop-cut estimates. Our inference from these findings is that the IR is an artifact of systematic over-reporting of production by farmers on small plots, and under-reporting on larger plots. We also discuss how rejecting the inverse plot-size productivity relationship has significant implications for the inverse farm-size productivity relationship.",31,16,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:130:y:2018:i:c:p:84-98,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2017.10.002,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v130y2018icp84-98.html,2020-03-09 19:14:07," 2018, Volume 130, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

In the model, formal workers commute every day to the Central Business District (CBD) to work in formal firms. Informal workers choose their commuting frequency knowing that they either can work at home and save on commuting costs, or have a higher remuneration at the CBD but incur commuting costs. We demonstrate that the difference in urban costs between formal and informal workers is a mechanism through which improvements in accessibility lead to lower informality rates. Next, we use the model to compare the impact and efficiency of four policy options: a hiring-costs subsidy and a transport subsidy for either all workers, formal workers, or informal workers. We find that a transport subsidy targeted at informal workers is undesirable. We also find that a hiring-costs subsidy is superior to transport subsidies in reducing informality.",33,0,RePEc:eee:deveco:v:130:y:2018:i:c:p:99-112,10.1016/j.jdeveco.2017.09.004,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v130y2018icp99-112.html,2020-03-09 19:14:10," 2018, Volume 130, Issue C","Journal of Development Economics, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/deveco.html

Yet, serious weaknesses in these statistics persist. The extent of bias in smallholder labor data is examined by conducting a randomized survey experiment among farming households in rural Tanzania. Agricultural labor estimates obtained through weekly surveys are compared with the results of reporting in a single end-of-season recall survey. The findings show strong evidence of recall bias: people in traditional recall-style modules reported working up to four times as many hours per person-plot as those reporting labor on a weekly basis. Recall bias manifests both in the intensive and extensive margins of labor reporting: while hours are over-reported in recall, the number of people and plots active in agricultural work are under-reported. The evidence suggests that this recall bias is driven not only by failures in memory, but also by the mental burdens of reporting on highly variable agricultural work patterns to provide a typical estimate.

This study qualitatively analyzes the micro level political discourses of the Food‐For‐Work programme, one of the top 10 SSNPs in Bangladesh, using the concepts of access, institutions and agency under livelihood framework. The analysis of the findings reveals that the programme is not effective in terms of the stated objectives of reducing poverty, but rather serves the interest of political elites.

They have improvised, organized, delivered and governed their social protection (SP) services using grassroots mechanisms without State support. Based on empirical studies in 30 districts in six African countries, this article makes the case that the highly localized models may not be perfect, but are probably the best fit for implementing an all‐encompassing SP policy in Africa.

My empirical analysis shows that Sweden managed to achieve this goal only for two years following the reform and that this was followed by backsliding. Moreover, its current aid policy framework barely mentions the topic. I argue that a major reason was the failure to institutionalize the policy.

Poverty, greed and corruption have bred political instability, conflicts and dependence on exporting primary products. For post‐colonial Africa to feel truly independent, its adoption of consensual democracy needs to be sincere. Ideological theories, the epistemological origins of development programmes, and the philosophy of choice cherished in consensual democracy have been overlooked in current African political cultures, which habitually disregard grassroots voices.

Yet some commentators argue that these organizations can have progressive impacts on political forms and processes. We investigate this debate through the lens of state building. Research into The AIDS Support Organisation's (TASO) work with the Ugandan government reveals that its state capacity building effects were both uneven and temporary. Although TASO played important roles in strengthening the bureaucratic ability of targeted hospitals to deliver HIV/AIDS services and increased the state's embeddedness in society in the targeted districts, it was less successful in expanding the infrastructural reach of the state in rural Uganda.

Discourse analysis is a collective name for a number of scientific methodologies for analyzing semiosis, namely how meaning is created and communicated though written, vocal or sign language. Employing a genealogical approach which locates discourses in the field of prior discourses, two prior discourses of the knowledge society are identified in the key document of the SDGs. The concepts knowledge and knowledge society are found to have a marginal position within the main policy document “Transforming our world,” adopted by the United Nations in September 2015. The techno‐scientific‐economic discourse is found to be dominant at the level of implementation and of goals, while there is some evidence of the pluralist‐participatory discourse at the level of vision and strategy. Analysis of some of the policy advice provided by international organizations and civil society indicates that more pluralist‐participatory discourses on knowledge were represented when the SDGs were being formulated.

Contributions in different parts of the country are affected by the local intensity of the 1994 genocide, with more generous contributions being made in areas where violence was greater.

Until the oil price shock, Angola had been succeeding in promoting rapid economic growth, and possibly even significant social development, alongside a massive grab of wealth and power by local elites. Today, though an economic crisis has taken hold, frequent predictions of the country's imminent collapse have yet to be fulfilled. This article reviews the state's development planning and expenditure with a focus on public investment and industrial development to determine to what extent Angola during this period might be considered a developmental or petro‐developmental state. It is argued that, while more significant than generally thought, petro‐developmental outcomes were and are limited by the autocratic and neopatrimonial tendencies of the Angolan elite. Nevertheless, limited success with structural transformation may have lasting effects. Following its long civil war, the conditions existed for Angola to follow a new path of state‐led development.

The analysis shows that the reform process was shaped by the interaction of two coalitions of actors: a donor‐dominated coalition that pushed for radical reform and advocated the total overhaul of the existing structures and the creation of new ones, with the aim of changing the mindset of the extension workers and managers towards the adoption of a more efficient, farmer‐oriented and performance‐based system. The other was a domestic coalition that believed in a “gradual” or “incremental” approach to promote changes and adjustments in the existing system to make it more efficient and accountable. This group was opposed to the complete overhaul of the existing extension system—taking an apparently more conservative stance.

Under crawling currency bands and managed floating, an increase in natural resource rents has little association with seigniorage. Under exchange rate regimes permitting greater exchange rate flexibility, greater natural resource rents allow less reliance on seigniorage.

The logistics infrastructure needed for this type of mining activity is of critical importance. The costs and potential inefficiencies involved in duplicating such infrastructure confer a significant competitive advantage on its owner in the absence of effective access regulation. In particular, where a first mover develops an â€˜integratedâ€™ project incorporating a mine and associated infrastructure, a failure to impose access regulation discourages thirdâ€ party investment in mineral exploration and development in the region serviced by the infrastructure, due to the risk of holdâ€ up by the first mover. An unregulated first mover can also use its infrastructure advantage to capture the state's share of resource rents from the mineral endowment of the region. Open access regulation further benefits host countries by enabling broadâ€ based economic development through the sharedâ€ use of mining infrastructure with other sectors (e.g., agribusiness). The article highlights contrasting experience with access regulation in Australia: the Pilbara iron ore region has seen protracted disputes involving mining firms and policyâ€ makers and very few examples of thirdâ€ party access, while in the coal region of central Queensland an extensive multiâ€ user, multiâ€ purpose railway network operates independently of mining firms.

Further evidence is provided by employing sample restrictions, adding more controls, and estimating a dynamic model with generalized method of moments (difference GMM). The optimal number of conditions estimated by our preferred GMM specification is 107, where the predicted policy score is about 0.96 points (1.33 SD) higher than with zero conditions.

We empirically test this hypothesis for rural Benin. Daily water collection times are reduced by 41 minutes but still take 2 hours after the installation of a public pump. Even though walking distances are reduced, women still spend a lot of time waiting at the water source, and not all women use the improved water source. Moreover, a reduction in time to fill one water container induces women to fill more containers per day. Time savings are rarely followed by an increase in the labor supply of women.

The poverty alleviation literature, however, has not yet addressed the important issue of policy design for efficient multidimensional poverty reduction. From a positive perspective, it is regularly observed that different poverty dimensions are often correlated and mutually reinforced, especially over time. From a normative perspective, it can be argued that in addition to being concerned with impacts on multiple dimensions of poverty, policy should also consider impacts on their joint distribution. This paper integrates these two perspectives into a consistent policy evaluation framework. Targeting dominance techniques are also proposed to assess the normative robustness of targeting strategies.

This paper quantifies the impact of malaria eradication in Costa Rica and explores whether precampaign regional characteristics can improve or damage the benefits of a health campaign. There are several results. First, using difference in differences I find that years of education of men and women increased in response to the eradication campaign but that only wages of males increased. Results are robust. Second, worse conditions in the school system and more child employment displaced schooling. Hence, health benefits may not translate into educational gains when the school system characteristics are bad or when the child labor market provides a better investment opportunity than schooling. Third, combining empirical evidence with a simple model, the increase in schooling cannot solely explain the increase in the income of men; however, health improvements explain most of the increase. Finally, the point estimates show that human capital gains were almost completely eliminated when a shortage of funding for eradication led to a resurgence of malaria; this emphasizes the fragility of the estimated benefits.",0,0,RePEc:ucp:ecdecc:doi:10.1086/695880,10.1086/695880,https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/ecdecc/doi10.1086-695880.html,2020-03-09 19:21:20," 2018, Volume 66, Issue 3","Economic Development and Cultural Change, University of Chicago Press",https://ideas.repec.org/s/ucp/ecdecc.html

Our replication exercise strongly supports their theory: mothers breastfeed daughters significantly less (especially if there are no elder sons) to increase the chances of becoming pregnant again with the hope to conceive a son.

We point out that the discussion was based on evidence from one single year only, while cows and buffalos are assets whose return varies through time. In drought years, when fodder is scarce and more expensive, milk production is lower and profits are low. In nondrought years, when fodder is abundant and cheaper, milk production is higher and profits can be considerably higher. Therefore, the return on cows and buffalos, like that of many stocks traded on Wall Street, is positive in some years and negative in others. The fact that in a given year the observed return on a risky asset is negative could certainly not be used as a contradiction of one of the basic tenets of capitalism.

Performing this exercise requires determining which features of exported products denote higher stages in that process. We argue that exports of differentiated products, especially when sold to developed countries, signal the acquisition of valuable knowledge that reflects development progress. We propose a new classification, denoted Micro-D, that works at the finest aggregation level in customs nomenclatures to provide a more precise identification of differentiated products. Specifically, the classification uses package size as a proxy for product differentiation to identify differentiated food and beverage exports. Thus, it is especially—though not exclusively—suited to capturing export upgrading in land-abundant developing countries. We apply the Micro-D classification to Argentina in 1998–2011 to deliver a new picture of the country’s sources of export upgrad- ing in this period.",0,1,RePEc:col:000425:016332,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/col/000425/016332.html,2020-03-09 19:22:16,"May 2018, Volume Volume 18 Number 2, Issue Spring 2018","Economía Journal, The Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association - LACEA",https://ideas.repec.org/s/col/000425.html

We show the first point through Monte Carlo experiments calibrated for the Venezuelan economy and the second point in an infinitely lived representative agent model that illustrates the problem of the joint determination of the level of central bank assets and the size of profits transferred to the treasury when the objective of the central bank is to eliminate the possibility of hyperinflation.",0,0,RePEc:col:000425:016333,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/col/000425/016333.html,2020-03-09 19:22:20,"May 2018, Volume Volume 18 Number 2, Issue Spring 2018","Economía Journal, The Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association - LACEA",https://ideas.repec.org/s/col/000425.html

Results reveal that the reduc­ tion in homicide rates due to the truce were associated with a migration within the education system, from public to private institutions, among boys aged fifteen to twenty­two years. The fluctuations in homicide rates were also associated with a lower school attendance for girls aged seven to fourteen years, especially due to a lower public school enrollment.

This paper aims at filling this gap by estimating the impact of quantitative restrictions on beef cattle exports in Bolivia, applying a synthetic control approach. Our main finding is that export restrictions have a negative impact not only on total production, but also on production for the domestic market. This fact, together with an increase in the domestic price, is consistent with a supply shift. The fact that export controls can shift supply and actually harm production for the domestic market bears important implications for the design of policies in the future.",0,0,RePEc:col:000425:016335,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/col/000425/016335.html,2020-03-09 19:22:27,"May 2018, Volume Volume 18 Number 2, Issue Spring 2018","Economía Journal, The Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association - LACEA",https://ideas.repec.org/s/col/000425.html

248,The Illusive Quest for Structural Transformation in Africa: Will China Make a Difference?,"['Alemayehu Geda', 'Lemma W Senbet', 'Witness Simbanegavi']","Despite various attempts since independence and the growing economic engagement between China and Africa in the last two decades, structural transformation in Africa has remained elusive. In the last six decades, and unlike China and East Asian countries, African countries failed to successfully transform their economies and thus upgrade their industrial capabilities to move up the ladder of value addition. There is, however, renewed efforts by African countries to industrialise as one of the ways to structurally transform their economies. African countries should ‘leverage their backwardness’ to attract industries and technologies that are consistent with their comparative advantages (Lin, 2018). Indeed, there appears to be growing interest in Africa from the Chinese labour-intensive manufacturing, who see Africa as a low cost production region, especially given the rising labour costs in China. With clear strategic policy direction, African countries can take advantage of the imminent relocation of a substantial share of China’s 85 million manufacturing jobs. This is not a foregone conclusion, since other regions are also trying to exploit this opportunity, and hence requiring African countries to solidify their competitive advantage for the imminent relocation. The studies, in this issue, while cautiously optimistic about the potential positive contribution of China for Africa’s structural transformation, underscore that such success is conditional on African capability and informed strategic policy making and implementation in a pragmatic manner.",0,0,RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:27:y:2018:i:suppl_1:p:i4-i14.,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/jafrec/v27y2018isuppl_1pi4-i14..html,2020-03-09 19:22:34," 2018, Volume 27, Issue suppl_1","Journal of African Economies, Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE)",https://ideas.repec.org/s/oup/jafrec.html

This article provides answers to five related questions: Why was it possible for China to achieve such extraordinary performance during its transition? Why was China unable to attain similar success before its transition started? Why did most other transition economies, including those in Africa, fail to achieve a similar performance? Can African countries have a similar performance as China had in the past three decades and how to do that? What are the opportunities for African countries from China’s rise? The paper concludes with a positive note: If the country in Africa adopt a pragmatic approach to develop its economy along its comparative advantages in a market economy and tap into the potential of latecomer’s advantages with a facilitating state, the African country can benefit from the pending relocation of China’s light manufacturing and grow dynamically like China.",0,1,RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:27:y:2018:i:suppl_1:p:i15-i28.,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/jafrec/v27y2018isuppl_1pi15-i28..html,2020-03-09 19:22:38," 2018, Volume 27, Issue suppl_1","Journal of African Economies, Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE)",https://ideas.repec.org/s/oup/jafrec.html

Drawing on fieldwork conducted between 2014 and 2015, the paper explores the varieties of existing Chinese manufacturing investment and the sectors into which Chinese companies are investing. We demonstrate in this paper that Chinese manufacturing investment in Africa is indeed expanding rapidly, yet the official data on investment approvals, both in China and in African countries, significantly overstates the actual number of investments in operation. Several investors do fit the model of Akamatsu’s ‘flying geese’: large firms seeking new locations for production as part of global networks and value chains. However, we also identified three other kinds of ‘geese’: large, strategic, local market-seeking geese; raw material-seeking geese; and small geese travelling together in flocks.

251,The Emerging Pattern of African Economic Engagement with China and the Rising South: Implications for Africa’s Structural Transformation,['Alemayehu Geda'],"The study critically examines the pattern of African economic engagement with China and the emerging South. The emerging pattern of trade and finance in this engagement is in the course of sustaining the problem of trading in primary commodities in Africa. Thus, this engagement is found to hinder structural transformation of the continent, is leading to low quality growth and has limited effect on poverty reduction. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is impossible without addressing such structural problems related to primary commodity trade with China through structural transformation of the continent. Although the engagement has both challenges and opportunities the persistence of challenges, as opposed to opportunities, in the current engagement shows the lack of both human and institutional capacity and the resulting lack of informed-policy to benefit from the China–Africa current economic engagement. Without such capacity and informed policy for strategic engagement, Africa may not benefit from its current engagement with China in the long run.",0,0,RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:27:y:2018:i:suppl_1:p:i52-i90.,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/jafrec/v27y2018isuppl_1pi52-i90..html,2020-03-09 19:22:45," 2018, Volume 27, Issue suppl_1","Journal of African Economies, Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE)",https://ideas.repec.org/s/oup/jafrec.html
252,Treating Schools to a New Administration: Evidence of the Impact of Better Practices in the System-Level Administration of Schools,"['Martin Gustafsson', 'Stephen Taylor']","A large body of literature focusses on how efficient practices in national and sub-national administrations can improve the welfare of citizens. Yet it is difficult to demonstrate this effect empirically, partly because citizens are not randomly assigned to different administrations and standard impact evaluation techniques are thus not viable. Within education, randomised trials that attribute educational improvement to specific interventions have been influential. Yet critics have argued that these studies, by focussing on single interventions, fail to prove their validity in a context of multiple interventions and, above all, weak system governance. The current paper takes advantage of provincial boundary changes occurring in South Africa, where provinces manage schools, to measure the effects of better administration, using a quasi-experimental approach. Changing to a more effective province was found to improve the mathematics performance of secondary school students, in national examinations, by a magnitude that is half of that seen in the fastest improving countries in international testing programmes. The replacement of teachers or school principals does not explain the improvement, though the addition of administrative support staff does emerge as a likely contributing factor. Greater efficiency, and not additional funding, appears to account for most of the change. It seems noteworthy that one of the provinces found to be relatively effective makes use of fixed-term contracts for senior managers in the administration, as opposed to permanent tenure, to enhance organisational capacity.",0,1,RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:27:y:2018:i:5:p:515-537.,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/jafrec/v27y2018i5p515-537..html,2020-03-09 19:22:49," 2018, Volume 27, Issue 5","Journal of African Economies, Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE)",https://ideas.repec.org/s/oup/jafrec.html

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by infections from a small worm. Its most severe effects hamper growth and cognitive development of children. The mass campaign targeted four states that saw large reduction in the infectious disease afterwards.

In particular, using a signal detection framework, we show that, when the level of financial development is low, the most used leading indicator of banking crisis, namely the credit-to-GDP gap, has poor predictive performance, as it is unable to disentangle episodes of financial deepening from bubble-like credit booms. On the contrary, a new class of indicators, comparing credit levels to structural benchmarks, has good capacity to correctly predict financial crises in economies in the early stages of financial development.",0,0,RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:27:y:2018:i:5:p:558-586.,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/jafrec/v27y2018i5p558-586..html,2020-03-09 19:22:56," 2018, Volume 27, Issue 5","Journal of African Economies, Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE)",https://ideas.repec.org/s/oup/jafrec.html

However, micro-entrepreneurs often undersave, even when they have some surplus and the desire to save. Knowledge gaps and behavioural biases such as limited attention have been discussed as potential constraints on saving. To test ways to alleviate such constraints, we offered a 4-hour financial literacy training and periodic SMS reminders for 3 months to a randomly selected group of micro-entrepreneurs in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We particularly compared the joint treatment to the two treatments in isolation for the first time in the literature. We find that SMS reminders increased savings relative to no treatment, and that the combination of reminders and financial training improved the financial literacy score and increased short-term deposits in the bank.

However, diffusion of knowledge or innovations can be slow and incomplete. We use a randomised field experiment in Uganda to assess the impact of providing incentives for knowledge diffusion, and pay trained individuals a fee if they share knowledge obtained during a financial literacy training.

This research delves into the ineffective implementation of fertility limiting preferences. We develop a theoretical model formalising the various determinants of a woman’s reproductive health behaviour during her reproductive years, focussing on choices related to effective contraception. The model incorporates the cyclicality and volatility of fecundity, paying particular attention to the stochastic nature of the reproduction process, as well as potential costs (such as lost wages and direct costs of purchase) and benefits (such as the ability to invest in her education and/or career) of being able to control or at least mitigate the volatility in the reproductive process. The model generates heterogeneity in the choice of contraceptive quality depending on both biological and economic factors. The nonparametic control function model, based on Malawian data, supports the notion that both biological and economic factors affect contraception decisions. The results suggest that fertility limiting preferences are being met, at least partially, in Malawi, and that the demographic transition is gaining traction.",8,0,RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:27:y:2018:i:4:p:405-429.,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/jafrec/v27y2018i4p405-429..html,2020-03-09 19:23:11," 2018, Volume 27, Issue 4","Journal of African Economies, Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE)",https://ideas.repec.org/s/oup/jafrec.html

We explore the modes of food acquisition, dietary diversity, caloric and protein intake, and qualitative food insecurity measures for different categories of respondents. We conduct a cross-sectional analysis comparing old clients to newly registered first time borrowers. Next, we compare first time borrowers and non-borrowers using a panel design. While the cross-sectional analysis allows the comparison of women that similarly self-selected into borrowing, the panel analysis complements by providing insights into changes of food security parameters. In both cases, we use Kernel matching, or difference-in-difference with Kernel matching, to control for potential bias in observables, and perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to unobservables using Rosenbaum bounds as well as an individual fixed effects panel analysis. Results show a decline in food security following the uptake of microcredit. In particular, the analysis reveals robustly lower dietary diversity among long-time borrowers than new borrowers, and larger reductions in dietary diversity scores among new borrowers, after 1 year, compared to controls. The reduction in dietary diversity was traced to a reduction in animal-source food, fruit and sugar intake. We find indicative evidence that this is partly explained by a shift from own production to reliance on food purchase by households.

Indeed, a match between poverty and deprivation occurs whenever household consumption expenditure and parental education are correlated. Second, using micro-level data from Tanzania, we find that parental education has a negative effect on the probability that a monetarily non-poor child suffers some basic deprivations, and a positive effect on the likelihood that a monetarily poor child suffers no basic deprivations.",18,1,RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:27:y:2018:i:4:p:483-512.,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/jafrec/v27y2018i4p483-512..html,2020-03-09 19:23:22," 2018, Volume 27, Issue 4","Journal of African Economies, Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE)",https://ideas.repec.org/s/oup/jafrec.html

What is less known is whether this resurgence has translated into a gradual process of convergence to the U.S. level. With the benefit of major upgrades in the source data, we employ well-tested and familiar methods in the development literature to sort out the quantitative importance of the fundamentals behind the process of convergence. While the SSA growth revival has generated local pride, foreign envy and enthusiasm from international policy makers, our results suggest a more sober tone. In 2010, per capita income and labour productivity levels relative to the U.S. are well below those reported during the pre-1990 period. Regardless of the way in which human capital is measured, relative factor input endowments constitute the primary force that held back the SSA relative labour productivity—a major departure from conventional wisdom. While the story from the sectoral level remains broadly consistent with the one obtained from the aggregate level, additional insights emerge. These include disproportionately lower relative levels of sectoral labour productivity that led to a considerably slow and atypical process of structural transformation. Although relative intersectoral labour productivity gaps have been reduced, sources of allocative inefficiency remain large. We argue that all indications point to a combination of favourable shocks behind the SSA wakening pulse rather than a set of economic fundamentals that feature a genuine economic development. The burst of the commodity prices in the mid-2014 that coincided with a sharp weakening of the performance of this economy constitutes a compelling counterfactual.",11,4,RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:27:y:2018:i:3:p:251-273.,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/jafrec/v27y2018i3p251-273..html,2020-03-09 19:23:30," 2018, Volume 27, Issue 3","Journal of African Economies, Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE)",https://ideas.repec.org/s/oup/jafrec.html

Studying the case of Burkina Faso, we use hand-collected data from individual responses to a survey we designed and conducted between May and June 2014. Our main results show that, although it is not possible to detect any correlation between using mobile money and saving for predictable events, it seems to increase the propensity of individuals to save for health emergencies. We also found robust evidence suggestive that using mobile money increases the propensity of disadvantaged groups such as rural, female, less educated individuals and individuals with irregular income to save for health emergencies.

Yet as a distinct financial device it has received little attention. The question is why it seems, in many contexts, to be preferred over standard life insurance even though the latter is a more flexible product. This paper presents a simple model in which funeral insurance differs from life insurance in that there is a constraint on how the payout is spent. Funeral insurance can therefore serve as an intergenerational commitment device.

However, explicit and implicit barriers to movement both within and between countries can hinder migration, potentially affecting welfare improvement. In this article, we use a unique panel dataset of tracked migrants and non-migrants that originate from 18 peasant associations in Ethiopia to examine the welfare impacts of internal migration. Using several techniques, we measure the association of migration with improved welfare among migrants relative non-migrants. We find that migrant welfare improves in a number of different ways; their non-food consumption rises by at least 145%, and we find that migrants also have improved diets relative to non-migrants. Gains are larger among male and urban migrants, as well as migrants who left a longer time in the past. The large welfare contribution of migration, conditional on migrating for employment, suggest that barriers exist, even within countries such as Ethiopia, against the free movement of people to places where they would be objectively better off.",21,1,RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:27:y:2018:i:3:p:347-365.,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/jafrec/v27y2018i3p347-365..html,2020-03-09 19:23:44," 2018, Volume 27, Issue 3","Journal of African Economies, Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE)",https://ideas.repec.org/s/oup/jafrec.html
268,The Lion on the Move Towards the World Frontier: Catching Up or Remaining Stuck?,"['Tarek M Harchaouia', 'Murat Üngörb']","The remarkable growth spurt reported by the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) economy since the mid-1990s offers the opportunity to revisit the narrative of its economic development experience. We investigate whether the SSA economy has initiated a gradual process of convergence which reverses the long-term fall so far behind the U.S. frontier. Our framework begins with a top-down approach that performs a nested development accounting exercise. This aggregate analysis complements a bottom-up approach that tracks the sectoral origins of the SSA aggregate relative labor productivity performance. The application of this framework to a representative sample of the SSA economy over the 1970-2010 period suggests the following set of results. After one-quarter of a century of falling behind the U.S. level of real income per capita, the SSA economy observed a swift turnaround towards the end of the 1990s, yet without showing any sign of catch-up. Second, parallel to favorable demographic developments, SSA reports a startling relative labor productivity gap which accounts for much of its relative income per capita gap. Third, the use of the concept of cognitive skills reveals that human capital considerations have worsened o_ over time, making total factor productivity no longer the biggest part of the story underlying relative labor productivity differences. Fourth, the sectoral evidence points to the coexistence of headwinds (negative within- and reallocation-effects) and tailwinds (between-effects) which tend to cancel out each other, thus preventing SSA aggregate economic performance to get anywhere closer to the world frontier even during the growth spurt period.",11,4,RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:27:y:2018:i:3:p:366-366.,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/jafrec/v27y2018i3p366-366..html,2020-03-09 19:23:48," 2018, Volume 27, Issue 3","Journal of African Economies, Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE)",https://ideas.repec.org/s/oup/jafrec.html

For this analysis we created a two-wave panel spanning 10 years to study exit, growth and decline, by re-surveying 1000 firms randomly selected from the 2003 National Industrial Census. We find strong differences in exit patterns by region and firm size. Former owners and managers commonly cite personal circumstances as the reason for exit in the case of small firms and increasing costs in the case of large firms. We show that both growth and selection played only a small role in the evolution of the firm size distribution, contradicting earlier work on Ghana. Overall, the picture we paint of manufacturing in Ghana is not a positive one: total employment by firms operating before 2003 decreased from 134,863 in 2003 to 74,319 in 2013, although we cannot explore to what extent new employment in firms that entered after 2003—who were not surveyed—compensated for this decline.",0,0,RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:27:y:2018:i:2:p:149-171.,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/jafrec/v27y2018i2p149-171..html,2020-03-09 19:23:55," 2018, Volume 27, Issue 2","Journal of African Economies, Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE)",https://ideas.repec.org/s/oup/jafrec.html

We use the 2010/11 South African Income and Expenditure Survey as it contains exclusive goods, i.e., goods consumed by specific household members, to be used for identification. We rely on a consumption model that accounts for (potentially unequal) resource sharing and jointness in consumption (generating economies of scale). Results indicate that men tend to receive more than women (even if imprecise estimates make the difference statistically insignificant), leading to sharp gender differences in terms of poverty. Ignoring economies of scale leads to an overestimation of poverty among adult men and women living with others.

We find that the effect of the reform on adolescent fertility and early marriage decreases with age, and that the effect becomes statistically insignificant after age 19.

Related to the issue of sustainability is economic structure. Diao et al.

Thorbecke and Ouyang (2018) also find that while the efficacy of translating growth into poverty reduction remains lower for Africa than elsewhere, there is evidence of poverty convergence recently in Africa, contrary to that for developing countries generally. Fosu (2018) observes the dominant importance, on average, of growth for poverty reduction in Africa, but also underscores the critical role of inequality, especially for certain countries. Exploring why inequality is particularly high in Africa, Shimeles and Nabassaga (2018) uncover ethnic fractionalisation, limited tertiary education, and poor governance as major culprits, and inequality of opportunity as the dominant component.

We show that in countries that have successfully industrialised, there is a strong positive correlation between labour productivity growth in agriculture and the manufacturing employment share up until the point at which the manufacturing employment share peaks. Since 1996, there is also a positive correlation between labour productivity in agriculture and the manufacturing employment share in Africa.

We examined both the impact of the pattern of growth on poverty and inequality (the growth–inequality–poverty (G–I–P) nexus); and the less studied reverse causal chain emanating from poverty to subsequent inequality and growth (the poverty–inequality–growth (P–I–G) nexus). For the G–I–P nexus, we found that poverty reduction is becoming more responsive to income growth and improvement in inequality in SSA in the post-2007 years; though the responsiveness remains smaller in SSA than in the developing world (with or without SSA) throughout the three decades examined. For the P–I–G nexus, we found that SSA again differs from the rest of the developing world in that SSA countries with the highest initial poverty incidence appeared to grow subsequently faster—leading to poverty convergence; while the developing world (with or without SSA) experienced a lack of poverty convergence during the same time period. We hypothesise that the main cause of poverty convergence in SSA during 1978–2007 might be due to anti-poverty interventions by governments and foreign public and private aid inversely proportional to the depth of poverty.",16,1,RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:27:y:2018:i:1:p:66-91.,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/jafrec/v27y2018i1p66-91..html,2020-03-09 19:24:21," 2018, Volume 27, Issue 1","Journal of African Economies, Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE)",https://ideas.repec.org/s/oup/jafrec.html

Countries with higher remittance flows also experienced lower inequality, whereas assets and goods market distortions tended to increase inequality in Africa. The paper also decomposed within-country inequality into components deemed to represent opportunities beyond the control of individuals and those attributed to individual efforts, such as education. At least 30% of asset inequality within countries was, on average, due to inequality of opportunity, though there were considerable differences across countries.

Successful integration tended to improve mixed methods impact evaluations by collecting better data to inform the study design and findings, which helped contextualise quantitative findings.

In 2015, the authors of this article along with a team of reviewers at 3ie used an updated search and screening protocol to identify new impact evaluation studies published until September 2015. By using systematic search and screening techniques to populate the repository, which contains 4,205 development impact evaluations published between 1981 and September 2015, we can use the data to analyse the trends in impact evaluation research. Though we find early evidence of a plateau in the growth rate of development impact evaluations, the number of studies published between January 2010 and September 2015 account for almost two thirds of the total evidence base. Over half of all studies fall under health and education sectors, though we see in the current decade an emergence of studies in formerly unrepresented sectors.

By recognising the value of qualitative research in providing valuable evidence on causal mechanisms, barriers, facilitators and the importance of context, mixed-methods systematic reviews go beyond the â€˜what worksâ€™ question. However, appropriate methods to screen and synthesise qualitative evidence in these reviews are still in a development phase, and the methodological literature dealing with reviewing qualitative evidence in the field of development studies is scarce and under-developed. This paper aims to contribute to this gap by discussing the methodological and practical challenges of including qualitative evidence in a mixed-methods systematic review in international development. In particular, this article makes a contribution in terms of offering reviewers and users of systematic reviews a full account of the process of screening and synthesising a very large volume of heterogeneous qualitative studies.

The authors systematically searched for and synthesised evidence from 35 quantitative and qualitative studies evaluating 17 individual interventions on the effectiveness of school-based decision-making on educational outcomes. Devolving decision-making to the level of the school appears to have a somewhat beneficial effect on dropout, repetition and teacher attendance. Effects on test-scores are more robust, being positive in aggregate and for middle-income countries specifically. On the other hand, school-based decision-making reforms appear to be less effective in communities with generally low levels of education, where parents have low status relative to school personnel.

Conventional four-wheeled tractors (4WTs) are not feasible for many smallholders owing to their high capital costs, unsuitability for fragmented holdings as well as topography and slope. More appropriate technologies are needed such as two-wheeled tractors (2WTs) and their requisite accessories. Our findings show that opportunities exist for the introduction of 2WTs in maize based systems through service provider models combining a number of operations that can be offered throughout the year and targeted to niche areas where 4WT access is unlikely.

This paper investigates the impact of this displacement on affected householdsâ€™ income and consumption patterns using a difference-in-differences approach and primary household-level data from the villages around the mine in two periods: one just before relocation in 2011 and another in 2015. In 2011, all households of the Wali Kali village, one of the seven project-affected villages, were involuntarily relocated. Project-affected families (PAFs) claim that their traditional earning sources have been inadequately replaced by mine-related earnings and that, being separated geographically, they now face difficulty maintaining social networks that are necessary for their survival. Once lost, rebuilding social networks is not easy in war-trampled Afghanistan. This paper clarifies these shadowy effects of forced relocation and demonstrates that traditional daily labour income was reduced significantly and only partially replaced by income from mine-related activities among those who were relocated and that relocation significantly discouraged the participation in community life, reflecting the losses of social capital among the PAFs due to separation.",0,0,RePEc:taf:jdevst:v:54:y:2018:i:11:p:2061-2077,10.1080/00220388.2017.1385767,https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/jdevst/v54y2018i11p2061-2077.html,2020-03-09 19:26:52,"November 2018, Volume 54, Issue 11","Journal of Development Studies, Taylor & Francis Journals",https://ideas.repec.org/s/taf/jdevst.html

South Asia has the highest rates of open defecation worldwide, and although the incidence declines as household income rises, differences across South Asian countries are not explained by differences in per capita income. The rate of open defecation in sub-national regions of Bangladesh, India and Nepal is highly correlated with the fraction of the population that identifies as Hindu, in part because certain rituals of purity and pollution discourage having latrines in close proximity to oneâ€™s home. Almost all open defecation occurs in rural areas, and this paper estimates how much the rate could be reduced if rural households in regions that have a higher fraction of Hindus, where open defecation is still common, altered their behaviour to reflect that of non-Hindu households in regions that are predominantly non-Hindu, where the rate of open defecation is much lower.

A Case-Study of the National Rural Livelihoods Mission in Rajasthan, India","['Shareen Joshi', 'Vijayendra Rao']"," It is widely acknowledged that top-down support is essential for bottom-up participatory projects to be effectively implemented at scale. However, which level of government, national or sub-national, should be given the responsibility to implement such projects is an open question, with wide variations in practice. This paper analyses qualitative and quantitative data from a natural experiment of a large participatory project in the state of Rajasthan in India comparing central management and state-level management.

333,Religious Fractionalisation and Crimes in Disaster-Affected Communities: Survey Evidence from Bangladesh,['Masahiro Shoji'], This study employs unique household data collected in cyclone-affected communities in Bangladesh to investigate whether religious fractionalisation is associated with crime victimisation after disasters. The identification strategy relies on two characteristics of the study area: 1) its religious composition is stable; and 2) its householdsâ€™ pre-disaster socio-economic status is uncorrelated with religious fractionalisation and disaster damage after controlling for the observed characteristics. The findings suggest that households in disaster-affected and religiously fractionalised communities are more likely to be victims after a natural disaster than are households in non-fractionalised communities.

335,The Challenges for Developing Countries in International Tax Justice,['Martin Hearson']," Developing countries face three main challenges in international tax cooperation. The most widely known are the twin problems of tax avoidance by foreign investors and tax evasion by domestic actors, which have become a major focus of debate in international organisations and of civil society activism in recent years. The second problem, tax competition, incorporates a range of issues from the â€˜prisonersâ€™ dilemmaâ€™ facing countries competing for inward direct investment through to the harmful tax rules used by tax havens that enable tax avoidance and evasion. This article reviews four recent monographs that analyse these problems at an international level. While they contain much useful discussion of the problems and potential technical solutions, there remains a need for political economy research to understand why certain technical solutions have not been adopted by governments. A third challenge faced by developing countries, barely considered in the tax and development literature up to now, leads to a note of caution: international tax institutions tend to be designed in ways that place disproportionate restrictions on capital-importing countriesâ€™ ability to tax foreign investors.",0,0,RePEc:taf:jdevst:v:54:y:2018:i:10:p:1932-1938,10.1080/00220388.2017.1309040,https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/jdevst/v54y2018i10p1932-1938.html,2020-03-09 19:27:55,"October 2018, Volume 54, Issue 10","Journal of Development Studies, Taylor & Francis Journals",https://ideas.repec.org/s/taf/jdevst.html

To evaluate the deterrence effect of the intervention on monthly tribal violence, I apply a difference-in-differences identification strategy which exploits within-districts variation in the outcome variable (violence) over time. The regression results show that military presence significantly deters tribal violence, that is, it decreases violent incidents by one to five per month.

Using a novel approach and nationwide sample survey, we measure various aspects of migrant networks such as size, diversity, efficiency and experience content and estimate their effect on probability of employment. Our findings suggest that migrant stock (having experience content) has an inverted-U relationship with the probability of finding a job for a migrant. The share of employed workers in a migrant network (efficiency) and different origin identity (diversity) positively affect the employment outcome through weak ties. Further, the migrant network effect is more active in larger cities as compared to smaller urban areas.

Moreover, if there is some heterogeneity in the identification of households as poor and vulnerable, it investigates the degree of mismatch between measures? The ex-post monetary poverty (MP) and multidimensional poverty (MDP) measures are used to identify poor households. Likewise, the ex-ante vulnerability to monetary poverty (VMP) and vulnerability to multidimensional poverty (VMDP) measures are used to identify vulnerable households. Using a large household survey data-set of about 90,000 households from the Punjab province of Pakistan, we find that most of the vulnerable households are accurately identified by the ex-ante measures of vulnerability to poverty. However, the ex-post measures of poverty identify different households as poor. Our results show that 18 percent households experiencing MDP are not captured by the one-dimensional measure of MP. The important implication of this study is that the choice of measures does matter in ex-post poverty identification, but not as much in the identification of ex-ante vulnerability to poverty.",0,0,RePEc:taf:jdevst:v:54:y:2018:i:9:p:1612-1636,10.1080/00220388.2017.1344646,https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/jdevst/v54y2018i9p1612-1636.html,2020-03-09 19:28:24,"September 2018, Volume 54, Issue 9","Journal of Development Studies, Taylor & Francis Journals",https://ideas.repec.org/s/taf/jdevst.html

To address the endogeneity of the geographical distribution of the Hoa, we use an important historical episode: the rapid deterioration in Sino-Vietnamese diplomatic relationship that led many ethnic Chinese to flee abroad, particularly to the refugee camps in the Guangxi province of China, in 1979. We find that the effects of proximity to the refugee camps on the share of ethnic Chinese in 1989 were more pronounced for provinces that had a larger presence of the ethnic Chinese population in 1979. We also find strong correlations between the 1989 share of ethnic Chinese (instrumented) and contemporary indicators of economic performance.

Empowerment is defined as the decision-making ability of a woman regarding her strategic and non-strategic life choices. Grounded in the Capability Approach and in the gender economics literature this conceptualisation accounts for three key elements: resources, values/traditions, and decision-outcomes.

354,The State of Female Autonomy in India: A Stochastic Dominance Approach,"['Kausik Chaudhuri', 'Gaston Yalonetzky']"," The promotion of female autonomy is both intrinsically and instrumentally desirable. We document differences in the distribution of female autonomy in India (using the National Family Health Survey 2005â€“2006) addressing two methodological challenges: the multidimensional nature of the concept and its frequent measurement with ordinal variables (which are not amenable to direct comparisons of social averages). We tackle these challenges with three methods based on stochastic dominance techniques suited for ordinal and dichotomous variables. Whenever these dominance conditions hold for a pairwise comparison, we can conclude that the multidimensional autonomy distribution in one state is more desirable than in another one across a broad range of criteria for the individual and social welfare evaluation of autonomy. Consistently across the three methods, we find that most of the states with better autonomy distributions (in pairwise comparisons) come from the north east and the south, whereas most of the states with worse autonomy distributions come from the north.",0,0,RePEc:taf:jdevst:v:54:y:2018:i:8:p:1338-1353,10.1080/00220388.2017.1414186,https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/jdevst/v54y2018i8p1338-1353.html,2020-03-09 19:29:05,"August 2018, Volume 54, Issue 8","Journal of Development Studies, Taylor & Francis Journals",https://ideas.repec.org/s/taf/jdevst.html

367,Effect of Parental Migration on the Academic Performance of Left Behind Children in North Western China,"['Yu Bai', 'Linxiu Zhang', 'Chengfang Liu', 'Yaojiang Shi', 'Di Mo', 'Scott Rozelle']"," Chinaâ€™s rapid urbanisation has induced large numbers of rural residents to migrate from their homes in the countryside to urban areas in search of higher wages. As a consequence, it is estimated that more than 60 million children in rural China are left behind and live with relatives, typically their paternal grandparents. These children are called Left Behind Children (LBCs). There are concerns about the potential negative effects of parental migration on the academic performance of the LBCs that could be due to the absence of parental care. However, it might also be that when a childâ€™s parents work away from home, their remittances can increase the householdâ€™s income and provide more resources and that this can lead to better academic performance. Hence, the net impact of out-migration on the academic performance of LBCs is unclear. This paper examines changes in academic performance before and after the parents of students out-migrate. We draw on a panel dataset collected by the authors of more than 13,000 students at 130 rural primary schools in ethnic minority areas of rural China. Using difference-in-differences and propensity score matching approaches, our results indicate that parental migration has significant, positive impacts on the academic performance of LBCs (which we measure using standardised English test scores).

We leverage these seemingly contradictory impacts of natural resources on society by expanding the scope of inquiry to explore different types of resource wealth (oil and minerals) as well as other dimensions of political life (protest). Utilising a global dataset for the period 1950â€“2006, we test the impact of resource wealth on mobilisation. We find that while oil wealth demobilises citizens in all regime types, mineral wealth strongly correlates with higher levels of mobilisation in democracies, though not in autocracies. In addition, using survey data, we examine individual-level attitudes toward protest participation in two resource-rich states, Peru and Ecuador.

376,Small Firmsâ€™ Formalisation: The Stick Treatment,"['Giacomo De Giorgi', 'Matthew Ploenzke', 'Aminur Rahman']"," Firm informality is pervasive throughout the developing world, Bangladesh being no exception. The informal status of many firms substantially reduces the tax basis and therefore impacts the provision of public goods. The literature on encouraging formalisation has predominantly focused on reducing the direct costs of formalisation and has found negligible impacts of such policies. In this paper, we focus on a stick intervention, which to the best of our knowledge is the first one in a developing country setting that deals with the most direct and dominant form of informality, that is registration with the tax authority with a direct link to the countryâ€™s potential revenue base and thus public goods provision. We implement an experiment in which randomly selected firms are visited by tax representatives who deliver an official letter from the Bangladesh National Tax Authority stating that the firm is not registered and the consequential punishment if the firm fails to register. We find that the intervention increases the rate of registration among treated firms, while firms located in the same market but not treated do not seem to respond significantly.

We then empirically test the hypotheses derived from the model by analysing the extension of a health insurance product in urban Hyderabad in Pakistan.

Using the 2006 Core Welfare Indicator Survey for Burundi we compare their food intake and their level of expenses with that of their non-displaced neighbours. We test whether it is the duration of displacement that matters for current food security and nutritional status or the time lapsed since returning home. We use log-linear as well as propensity score matching and an instrumental variable-approach to control for self-selection bias. We find that the individuals and HHs who returned home just before the time of the survey are worse off compared to those who returned several years earlier. On average, the formerly displaced have 5 per cent lower food expenses and 6 per cent lower calorie intake. Moreover, we find evidence in favour of duration of displacement as the main mechanisms through which displacement affects HH welfare. Results are robust after controlling for self-selection bias.

The drivers of the regionâ€™s economic transformations are diverse, and include improved governance, strong agricultural growth in some countries, employment expansion in informal rural off-farm activities, strong local and foreign investment, a period of high global commodity prices, and policy reforms undertaken in earlier decades.

386,Africaâ€™s Evolving Employment Trends,"['Felix Kwame Yeboah', 'Thomas S. Jayne']"," Using nationally representative data from nine countries, we document demographic and employment trends in Africaâ€™s workforce based on full-time labour equivalents (FTE). The FTE approach takes account of individualsâ€™ multiple jobs throughout the year and is therefore likely to give more accurate estimates of the pace of structural transformation. Since 2000, Africa has experienced a sharp decline in the share of its labour force in farming. Because of the seasonal nature of farming, the share of the labour force remaining in farming is substantially lower using the FTE approach than when examined in terms of individualsâ€™ primary sources of employment or total numbers of jobs. Using the FTE approach, the share of the labour force in farming ranges across the nine countries from 35 per cent in Ghana to 54 per cent in Rwanda. Employment in off-farm segments of agri-food systems is expanding rapidly in percentage terms, but in terms of absolute numbers, non-farm activities are by far the major source of employment outside of farming. Contrary to widespread perceptions, the mean age of adults engaged primarily in farming is not rising â€“ in fact it is falling slightly in some countries and remains stable in most others. The pace at which the labour force is shifting out of agriculture is strongly and positively tied to the rate of lagged farm productivity growth. Given the unprecedented growth in the number of young Africans entering the labour market, an effective youth employment strategy in most African countries will rely on massive job expansion, which in turn will rely on the multiplier effects of agricultural productivity growth. Strategies that raise the returns to labour in farming therefore remain crucial for achieving rapid economic transformation and may constitute the core of effective youth employment strategies.",0,6,RePEc:taf:jdevst:v:54:y:2018:i:5:p:803-832,10.1080/00220388.2018.1430767,https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/jdevst/v54y2018i5p803-832.html,2020-03-09 19:31:03,"May 2018, Volume 54, Issue 5","Journal of Development Studies, Taylor & Francis Journals",https://ideas.repec.org/s/taf/jdevst.html

Welfare is measured by various dimensions of poverty and food insecurity; and agricultural productivity is measured by maize yield and value of crop output per hectare. The poverty measures included per capita consumption expenditure, relative deprivation in terms of per capita consumption expenditure, poverty gap and severity of poverty; and the measures of food insecurity included caloric intake and relative deprivation in terms of caloric intake. Depending on the measure of welfare, the impact of agricultural productivity was estimated with a household fixed effects estimator, a two-part estimator or a correlated-random effect ordered probit estimator. The results indicate that growth in agricultural productivity has the expected welfare-improving effect. In terms of economic magnitude, however, both the direct effect and economy-wide spillover effect (in the non-farm sector) of a percentage increase in agricultural productivity on the poverty and food security measures are small.

A second question tackles the respective effects of various dimensions of social networks on business technical efficiency. The hypothesis is that, beyond the channel of labour productivity, entrepreneurs that are confronted with an unfavourable social environment may produce less efficiently and realise a lower output than what could be possible with the same amount of resources.

This study uses an unprecedentedly large amount of nationally representative survey data from Indonesia. Based on 13 different datasets that were collected between 2000 and 2014, and which together contain disability information on more than 1 billion individuals, we assess how robust disability profiles are to measurement issues. Our findings suggest that irrespective of the dataset and measure used, disability is disproportionally more common among the poor, the elderly and rural areas in the country.

398,Allocating Family Responsibilities for Dependent Older People in Mexico and Peru,"['Peter Lloyd-Sherlock', 'Rosie Mayston', 'Alberto Acosta', 'Sara Gallardo', 'Mariella Guerra', 'Ana Luisa Sosa', 'Veronica Montes de Oca', 'Martin Prince']"," This paper applies different analytical frameworks to explore processes of family bargaining about providing care for dependent older people in Mexico and Peru. These frameworks include cultural norms, life course effects and material exchange. The paper is based on 19 in-depth qualitative family case studies, which are linked to a wider set of quantitative survey data. Care arrangements and bargaining processes are revealed to be highly gendered, and largely conform to prevailing cultural norms. Rather than neutral and objective, the self-identified role as main carer is found to be subjective and potentially ambiguous. The few men who self-identify as main carers are more likely to play an indirect, organisational role than engage directly in daily care. As such, bargaining mainly relates to which woman performs the main care role, and large family networks mean that there is usually more than one candidate carer. Bargaining can occur inter-generationally and conjugally, but bargaining between siblings is of particular importance. Bargaining is framed by the uncertain trajectory of older peopleâ€™s care needs, and arrangements are sometimes reconfigured in response to changing care needs or family circumstances.

Implementing a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) may exacerbate crowding out because recipient governments should face fewer constraints when allocating health aid. This paper uses rigorous panel data methods to investigate this hypothesised effect of SWAps.

We use the ARDL bounds testing approach to deal with problems of autocorrelation and non-stationarity of key variables. Rather than rainfall, we find that it is maximum temperature that has long and short run effects on collective violence, with unidirectional causality from temperature shocks to riots. A one standard deviation increase in maximum temperature over the long run average increases the number of riots by 55 per cent. Return to long run equilibrium after a temperature shock takes approximately 15 years. The insignificance of rainfall holds whether we consider rainfall levels or rainfall growth. Given the absence of long run relationships between income levels /growth and riots, it is unlikely that the income channel is the one through which climate affects riots in India. Instead, the evidence suggests a psychological channel through which temperature affects riots in India, with hotter temperatures being associated with increased levels of aggression.",0,1,RePEc:taf:jdevst:v:54:y:2018:i:3:p:441-456,10.1080/00220388.2016.1269890,https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/jdevst/v54y2018i3p441-456.html,2020-03-09 19:32:17,"March 2018, Volume 54, Issue 3","Journal of Development Studies, Taylor & Francis Journals",https://ideas.repec.org/s/taf/jdevst.html

We show that such mutations can result from rational behavior when the dictator’s flow use of repression is complementary to his stock of wrongdoings: past wrongdoings then perpetuate further wrongdoings and the dictator can unintentionally get trapped in a repressive steady state where he himself suffers from ex-post regret. This then begs the question why such a dictator would ever choose to do wrong in the first place. We show that this can be explained from the dictator’s uncertainty over his degree of impunity in relation to wrongdoing, which induces him to experiment along this dimension.

440,Why Is China Investing in Africa? Evidence from the Firm Level,"['Wenjie Chen', 'David Dollar', 'Heiwai Tang']","China’s increased trade with, and investment in, Africa have boosted the continent’s economic growth but have also generated considerable controversy. The aggregate data on China’s overseas direct investment (ODI) in African countries reveal that China’s share of the stock of foreign investment is small, though growing rapidly. China’s attraction to resource-rich countries is no different from Western investment. China’s overall ODI is uncorrelated with a measure of rule of law, whereas Western investment favors the better governance environments. As a result, Chinese investment in strong and weak governance environments is about the same, but its share of foreign investment is higher in the weak governance states. Micro data from MOFCOM’s database on registered Chinese firms investing in Africa between 1998 and 2012 provide a different perspective. Key words in project descriptions are used to code the investments into 25 sectors. This database captures the small and medium private firms investing in Africa. Contrary to common perceptions, there are few projects in natural resource sectors. Most projects are in services, with a significant number in manufacturing as well. Country-sector-level regressions based on firms’ transaction-level data find that Chinese ODI, both horizontal and vertical, is profit-driven, like investment from other countries. In particular, regressions show that Chinese ODI is relatively more concentrated in skill-intensive sectors in skill-abundant countries but in capital-intensive sectors in capital-scarce countries.

Evidence from Jordan,"['Ragui Assaad', 'Mohamed Saleh']","The impact of the growth of the local supply of public schools in the post-Colonial period on intergenerational mobility in education is a first-order question in the Arab World. This question is examined in Jordan using a unique dataset that links individual data on own schooling and parents’ schooling for adults, from a household survey, with the supply of schools in the subdistrict of birth at the time the individual was of age to enroll, from a school census. The identification strategy exploits the variation in the supply of basic and secondary public schools across cohorts and subdistricts of birth in Jordan, controlling for year and subdistrict-of-birth fixed effects and interactions of governorate and year-of-birth fixed effects. The findings show that the local availability of basic public schools does, in fact, increase intergenerational mobility in education. For instance, a one standard deviation increase in the supply of basic public schools per 1,000 people reduces the father-son and mother-son associations of schooling by 18–20 percent and the father-daughter and mother-daughter associations by 33–44 percent.

Wages were highly procyclical during the 1980s and early 1990s, a period characterized by high inflation. As inflation declined wages became less procyclical, a feature that is consistent with emerging downward wage rigidities in a low inflation environment.

Results indicate high levels of usage and approval of the shoes by children in the treatment group, and time diaries show modest evidence that the donated shoes allocated children’s time toward outdoor activities. Difference-in-difference and ANCOVA estimates find generally insignificant impacts on overall health, foot health, and self-esteem but small positive impacts on school attendance for boys. Children receiving the shoes were significantly more likely to state that outsiders should provide for the needs of their family.

This paper calculates the costs of microcredit and other elements of the microcredit business model using proprietary data on 1,335 microfinance institutions between 2005 and 2009, jointly serving 80.1 million borrowers. The costs of making small loans to poorer clients are high, and when revenues fall short of costs, subsidies are necessary to deliver services to those clients on a sustainable basis. Using a method that accounts for the opportunity costs of all forms of subsidy, the analysis finds that the median institution receives five cents of subsidy per dollar lent and $51 of subsidy per borrower (in PPP-adjusted terms). Relatively low levels of median subsidy suggest that even modest benefits of microcredit could yield impressive cost-benefit ratios. The distribution of subsidies is highly skewed, however: the average subsidy per dollar lent is 13 cents, and the average subsidy per borrower is $248. The data show that subsidies per borrower are substantially higher for commercial microfinance banks and some non-bank financial institutions that make relatively large loans.

Our results show that the effect of aid on growth is significantly lower when aid was committed during a country’s tenure on the UNSC. This holds when we restrict the sample to Africa, which follows the strictest norm of rotation on the UNSC and thus where UNSC membership can most reliably be regarded as exogenous.

Estimations are based on monthly market prices of four agricultural commodities (maize, groundnuts, rice, and beans) in 27 local markets for the period 1998–2006. Market pairs connected by rail when the railway line was operational are intervention observations. Railway transport services explain a 14 to 17 percent reduction in price dispersion across markets.

Though greater leverage was generally associated with a higher predicted probability of institutional survival, the reverse was true where blight infection was more severe, and though more profitable funds were generally no more likely to survive, higher pre-famine margins were positive predictors of institutional survival where blight infection was worse. Results further indicate that the primary mechanisms by which pre-famine balance sheet metrics influenced survival probabilities were differential balance sheet contraction and flight-to-quality during the famine. The results of this study, therefore, suggest that optimal lending models in ordinary circumstances may render microfinance institutions (MFIs) more vulnerable to tail-probability aggregate shocks, with higher leverage, lower paid staff, lower economic rents, and more extensive liabilities limiting the scope for credit retrenchment and flight-to-quality.

Because HO’s model includes user fees, which raise concerns about equity, I quantify the equity-efficiency tradeoff posed by community-based and aid interventions by determining the preferences of a social planner indifferent between these types of water infrastructure interventions.

Using Malaysian data for 2003-10, this paper provides estimates of the overall impact of economic immigration on crime, and evidence on different socio-economic mechanisms underpinning this relationship. The IV estimates suggest that immigration decreases crime rates, with an elasticity of around −0.97 for property and -1.8 violent crimes. Three-quarters of the negative causal relationship between immigration and property crime rates can be explained by the impact of immigration on the underlying economic environment faced by natives. The reduction in violent crime rates is less readily explained by these factors.",9,1,RePEc:oup:wbecrv:v:32:y:2018:i:1:p:183-202.,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/wbecrv/v32y2018i1p183-202..html,2020-03-09 19:36:08," 2018, Volume 32, Issue 1","World Bank Economic Review, World Bank Group",https://ideas.repec.org/s/oup/wbecrv.html

We design and implement a randomized control trial to quantitatively assess the role of communication between migrants and their international network on the extent and value of remittance flows. In the experiment, a random sample of 1,500 migrants residing in Ireland was offered the possibility of contacting their networks outside the host country for free over a varying number of months. We find a sizeable positive impact of our intervention on the value of migrant remittances sent. Larger remittance responses are associated with individuals who are employed and earn higher incomes. This evidence is consistent with the idea that the observed increase in remittances is not a consequence of relaxed budget constraints due to subsidized communication costs but rather a likely result of improved information, perhaps due to better migrant control over remittance use, enhanced trust in remittance channels due to experience sharing, or increased remittance recipients’ social pressure on migrants.",22,16,RePEc:oup:wbecrv:v:32:y:2018:i:1:p:203-219.,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/wbecrv/v32y2018i1p203-219..html,2020-03-09 19:36:12," 2018, Volume 32, Issue 1","World Bank Economic Review, World Bank Group",https://ideas.repec.org/s/oup/wbecrv.html

The technology has spread rapidly in the developing world, “leapfrogging” the provision of formal banking services by solving the problems of weak institutional infrastructure and the cost structure of conventional banking. This article examines the evolution of mobile money and its important role in widening financial inclusion. It explores the channels of economic influence of mobile money from a micro perspective, and critically reviews the empirical literature on the economic impact of mobile money.

To do so requires information on the nature and magnitude of market failures on the one hand, and government's capacity to redress them successfully on the other. This article reviews perspectives on vertical (sectoral) and horizontal (factor markets, cluster) policies with a view to both criteria. We first argue that the case for either vertical or horizontal policies cannot be made on the basis of the likelihood of successful implementation: for instance, educational policies and “picking the winner” types of policies both run the risks of capture and incompetent execution. However, the economics profession has been able to establish more convincing market failures for horizontal policies than for vertical policies. Most of the recent approaches to identifying failures around particular goods are of limited help. Hence, for a given difficulty of execution, the former are generally preferred. A second critical message is that improving the quality of governance in terms of collecting information, coordination ability, and defending against capture is critical to the successful implementation of productivity policies and should be central on the policy agenda.",0,0,RePEc:oup:wbrobs:v:33:y:2018:i:2:p:189-217.,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/wbrobs/v33y2018i2p189-217..html,2020-03-09 19:36:19," 2018, Volume 33, Issue 2","World Bank Research Observer, World Bank Group",https://ideas.repec.org/s/oup/wbrobs.html

However, little is known about how CTs achieve this impact. We conducted a mixed-method review of studies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Fourteen quantitative and eight qualitative studies met our inclusion criteria, of which eleven and five, respectively, demonstrated evidence that CTs decrease IPV. We found little support for increases in IPV, with only two studies showing overall mixed or adverse impacts. Drawing on these studies, as well as related bodies of evidence, we developed a program theory proposing three pathways through which CT could impact IPV: (a) economic security and emotional well-being, (b) intra-household conflict, and (c) women's empowerment. The economic security and well-being pathway hypothesizes decreases in IPV, while the other two pathways have ambiguous effects depending on program design features and behavioral responses to program components. Future studies should improve IPV measurement, empirical analysis of program mechanisms, and fill regional gaps. Program framing and complementary activities, including those with the ability to shift intra-household power relations are likely to be important design features for understanding how to maximize and leverage the impact of CTs for reducing IPV, and mitigating potential adverse impacts.

Specifically, it investigates if transfers: 1) induce higher spending on alcohol or tobacco; 2) are fully consumed (rather than invested); 3) create dependency (reduce participation in productive activities); 4) increase fertility; 5) lead to negative community-level economic impacts (including price distortion and inflation); and 6) are fiscally unsustainable. The paper presents evidence refuting each claim, leading to the conclusion that these perceptions—insofar as they are utilized in policy debates—undercut potential improvements in well-being and livelihood strengthening among the poor, which these programs can bring about in sub-Saharan Africa, and globally.

This paper discusses four additional mechanisms that can be explained by bounded rationality: (a) implicit discrimination, (b) self-stereotyping and self-censorship, (c) rules of thumb adapted to disadvantaged environments that are dysfunctional in more privileged settings, and (d) “adaptive preferences,” in which an excluded group comes to view its exclusion as natural. Institutions, if they are stable, come to have cognitive foundations---concepts, categories, social identities, and worldviews---through which people mediate their perceptions of themselves and the world around them. Abolishing or reforming a discriminatory institution may have little effect on the social categories it created; groups previously discriminated against by law may remain excluded through custom and habits of the mind. Recognizing new forces of social exclusion, behavioral economics identifies ways to offset them.

This paper systematically reviews all RCTs conducted in developing countries and published in leading economic journals between 2009 and 2014 with respect to how they deal with external validity. Following Duflo, Glennerster, and Kremer (2008), we scrutinize the following hazards to external validity: Hawthorne effects, general equilibrium effects, specific sample problems, and special care in treatment provision. Based on a set of objective indicators, we find that the majority of published RCTs does not discuss these hazards and many do not provide the necessary information to assess potential problems.

Overall, the literature now reflects a more cautious and nuanced evaluation of privatization.

477,Public-Private Partnerships in Developing Countries: The Emerging Evidence-based Critique,['James Leigland'],"Advocates of public-private partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructure services in developing countries have long battled criticism of these arrangements by civil society groups. The view among PPP advocates generally has been that these criticisms are mostly ideological polemics that mix opinion with selected but often misinterpreted facts. But over the last two decades, as the experience with PPPs has increased in both developed and developing countries, a different kind of critique has emerged, one that is based on non-ideological empirical research, and is sometimes expressed by PPP advocates. These studies often focus on individual aspects of PPPs, and usually do not claim to be “PPP evaluations” or express opinions on the overall value of PPPs. Taken together, a powerful, evidence-based critique of PPPs is emerging, but one that is more measured than much of the criticism of the last two decades. This new critique recognizes many cases in which PPPs have not been successful, but also some situations in which PPPs can generate value for money. Because of its critical tone, some of this research is now regularly cited by the civil society critics of PPPs, giving their arguments more weight than was the case a decade ago. This paper attempts to summarize some of the most compelling examples of this kind of emerging critique, and uses the summary to assess the practicality of the G20’s recent advocacy of large, “transformational” PPPs as tools for dealing effectively with infrastructure challenges in low-income countries.",0,0,RePEc:oup:wbrobs:v:33:y:2018:i:1:p:103-134.,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/wbrobs/v33y2018i1p103-134..html,2020-03-09 19:36:42," 2018, Volume 33, Issue 1","World Bank Research Observer, World Bank Group",https://ideas.repec.org/s/oup/wbrobs.html

Temperature shocks have a negative and significant impact on household growth if their initial consumption lies below a critical threshold. As such, temperature shocks slow income convergence among households, at least in the short run. Crop yields and total factor productivity in agriculture are the main transmission channels. Extrapolating from short-term elasticities to long-run phenomena, these findings support the Schelling Conjecture: economic development would help poor farming households to reduce the impacts of climate change.

Rents could induce firms to lobby or bribe governments to preserve the status quo; on the other hand, rents may promote growth by giving firms the needed funds to make investments in fixed capital or research and development. To test this question empirically, we use a panel of manufacturing data at the industry-country-year level, and measure rents by the mark-up ratio. We find that the relationship between rents and growth is strongly negative, with the results being primarily driven by the poorer countries (or those with worse institutions) in the sample. This result holds when we instrument for mark-up using the average mark-up in other industries in the country. Even in industries with high external financing needs and countries with less developed financial sectors, precisely the places where excess profits could be used to drive growth, we find that rents are especially harmful. Consistent with the rent-seeking mechanism we highlight, we find that high rents are associated with a slower reduction in tariffs. We also test for the most likely alternative mechanism, that higher rents cause slower growth through the channel of allowing managerial slack. We find that controlling for management has little impact on our estimate of the impact of mark-up on productivity growth.",43,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:112:y:2018:i:c:p:33-45,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.07.014,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v112y2018icp33-45.html,2020-03-09 19:36:53," 2018, Volume 112, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

The index is calculated for 114 countries from 1960 to 2014. A country is defined as trapped if it takes longer than a benchmark period to move from one income category to another.

We find suggestive evidence of a short-term improvement in some education services, but these effects deteriorate by year two of the program, and we find little or no evidence of an effect on health and water services at any period. Despite relatively high levels of system uptake, enthusiasm of district officials, and anecdotal success stories, we find that relatively few messages from citizens provided specific, actionable information about service provision within the purview and resource constraints of district officials, and users were often discouraged by officials’ responses.

The countercyclicality of multilateral development bank (MDB) lending is mostly driven by the behavior of the World Bank (borrowing from regional development banks tends to be acyclical). The paper also shows that MDB lending to Latin America and East Asia is more countercyclical than MDB lending to other regions. Private sector lending is instead procyclical in all developing regions. While the cyclicality of MDB lending does not depend on domestic or international conditions, private lending becomes particularly procyclical in periods of limited global capital flows. By focusing on both borrower and lender heterogeneity, the paper shows that the cyclical properties of international government debt are mostly driven by credit supply shocks. Demand factors appear to be less important drivers of procyclical international government borrowing.

Published research on NGOs has paralleled this growth, yet there exists scant synthesis of the literature. This article presents a synthesis, while also introducing a collaborative research platform, the NGO Knowledge Collective. We ask four questions: first, who studies NGOs, and how do they study them? Second, what issues, sectors and places are studied when NGOs are the focus? Third, what effect do NGO activities have on specific development outcomes? And fourth, what path should the NGO research agenda take? To answer these questions, we conduct a mixed-method systematic review of social science publications on NGOs, which includes computer-assisted content analysis of 3336 English-language journal articles (1980–2014), alongside a close, qualitative analysis of 300 randomly selected articles. We find, first, that interdisciplinary journals dominate NGO publishing, that research on NGOs is more qualitative than quantitative, and that practitioners publish, but Northern academics create most published knowledge. Second, we find the literature is framed around six overarching questions regarding: the nature of NGOs; their emergence and development; how they conduct their work; their impacts; how they relate to other actors; and how they contribute to the (re)production of cultural dynamics. Articles also focus disproportionately on the most populated and/or politically salient countries, and on the governance and health sectors. Third, we find that scholars generally report favorable effects of NGOs on health and governance outcomes. Fourth, we propose a research agenda calling for scholars to: address neglected sectors, geographies, and contextual conditions; increase author representativeness; improve research designs to include counterfactuals or comparison groups; and better share data and findings, including results from additional, focused NGO-related systematic reviews.

487,Mobility equity in a globalized world: Reducing inequalities in the sustainable development agenda,"['Hackl, Andreas']","Human mobility and inequality have determined one another throughout modern history, from the effects of labour migration to processes of urbanisation. The Sustainable Development Goals now offer an opportunity to re-examine this complex relationship in a globalized world. Drawing on major research evidence and key debates, this review article proposes a framework of mobility equity as part of SDG 10, which foresees the reduction of inequalities within and among countries by 2030. The main question addressed is how forms of social, human and digital mobility, including migration, can contribute to reduced inequalities and positive development outcomes. The reviewed research underpins the need for an approach that prioritizes equality of opportunity over equality of outcomes. Mobility equity offers such an approach and rests on two main foundations: people’s equal capacity and freedom to be mobile in empowering ways, and the equal and inclusive regulation of mobility in all its forms, including human, social and digital mobility.

488,Foods and fads: The welfare impacts of rising quinoa prices in Peru,"['Bellemare, Marc F.', 'Fajardo-Gonzalez, Johanna', 'Gitter, Seth R.']","Riding on a wave of interest in “superfoods” in rich countries, quinoa went in less than a decade from being largely unknown outside of South America to being an upper-class staple in the United States, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere. As a result, concerned commentators suggested that the rising international demand for quinoa, which tripled prices, might have substantially harmed Peruvian quinoa consumers. We study the impacts of rising quinoa prices on the welfare of Peruvian households. Our analysis suggests these fears are unwarranted. A descriptive analysis shows that quinoa is a small part (<1%) of the average household’s budget share for the roughly 30% of households that consume quinoa. Our econometric analysis generally finds that as quinoa prices rose, welfare increased in regions with higher concentrations of quinoa consumers. Specifically, we use 11 years of a large-scale, nationally representative household survey to construct pseudo-panels at three geographic (district, province, and department) levels to look at the relationship between the international price of quinoa and the value of real household consumption, our proxy for household welfare. We find for the two smaller geographic regions (i.e., districts and provinces) higher concentrations of quinoa consumption or production are associated with a small and statistically significant increase in household welfare in response to quinoa price increases; in the largest regions (i.e., departments), higher concentrations of quinoa consumption or production are associated with small declines in welfare of less than 1% of total household consumption. Our findings that the international trade of quinoa has not been harmful to household welfare in Peru thus run counter to some of the myths surrounding quinoa.",23,4,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:112:y:2018:i:c:p:163-179,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.07.012,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v112y2018icp163-179.html,2020-03-09 19:37:24," 2018, Volume 112, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
489,Micro(soft) managing a ‘green revolution’ for Africa: The new donor culture and international agricultural development,"['Schurman, Rachel']","The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) has become an influential development actor, spending billions of dollars on international health and agricultural development. While scholars commonly assert that the foundation is part of a new breed of “philanthrocapitalists” who apply business principles to their philanthropic activities, little is known about what this really means or how the Gates Foundation works on the inside. This article seeks to deepen our understanding of this new development actor by examining its organizational culture. I do this through a case study of the Gates Foundation’s Agricultural Development program. Using in-depth interviews, materials from the BMGF’s website, and a variety of other primary data sources, I explore the foundation’s quotidian practices, workplace norms, and interactions with grantees as it tries to improve the lives of smallholder farmers in Africa. I argue that the Gates Foundation’s heavy emphasis on strategic planning has produced an approach to agricultural development that abstracts away from smallholder farmers’ sociocultural worlds and relies on a generalizable set of development solutions. My analysis also reveals another significant consequence of the BMGF’s organizational culture: By immersing bright, high-achieving professionals in the competitive, intense environment that characterizes the foundation, staff have learned to “manage up” (toward Bill) rather than manage down (toward their intended beneficiaries). This insulates and distances foundation staff from the field, making it difficult for them to listen to smallholder farmers, even though many express a genuine desire to do so. As a result, farmers continue to be treated as passive objects of development rather than as complex social actors.",8,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:112:y:2018:i:c:p:180-192,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.08.003,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v112y2018icp180-192.html,2020-03-09 19:37:27," 2018, Volume 112, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

The aim of this study was to describe and analyze the processes involved in young, married women’s negotiations of control over cash inside the extended household in a contemporary rural Nepali setting. We conducted a grounded theory study of 42 households from the Plains of Nepal. Our study uncovered multiple ways in which junior wives and husbands in the extended household became secret allies in seeking financial autonomy from the rule of the mother-in-law to the wife. This included secretly saving up for a household separation from the in-laws. We argue these secret financial strategies constitute a means for junior couples to renegotiate the terms of Kandiyoti’s (1988) ‘patriarchal bargain’ wherein junior wives traditionally had to accept subservience to their husband and mother-in-law in exchange for economic security and eventual authority over their own daughters-in-law.

491,Can farmers adapt to higher temperatures? Evidence from India,"['Taraz, Vis']","Projections suggest that the damages from climate change will be substantial for developing countries. Understanding the ability of households in these countries to adapt to climate change is critical in order to determine the magnitude of the potential damages. In this paper, I investigate the ability of farmers in India to adapt to higher temperatures. I use a methodology that exploits short-term weather fluctuations as well as spatial variation in long-run climate. Specifically, I estimate how damaging high temperatures are for districts that experience high temperatures more or less frequently. I find that the losses from high temperatures are lower in heat-prone districts, a result that is consistent with adaptation. However, while adaptation appears to be modestly effective for moderate levels of heat, my results suggest that adaptation to extreme heat is much more difficult. Extremely high temperatures do grave damage to crops, even in places that experience these temperature extremes regularly. The persistence of negative impacts of high temperatures, even in areas that experience high temperatures frequently, underscores the need for development policies that emphasize risk mitigation and explicitly account for climate-change-related risks.",49,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:112:y:2018:i:c:p:205-219,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.08.006,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v112y2018icp205-219.html,2020-03-09 19:37:35," 2018, Volume 112, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
492,Why the poor do not benefit from community-driven development: Lessons from participatory budgeting,"['Saguin, Kidjie']","Community-driven development (CDD) has been identified as a potent vehicle for poverty reduction. Over 105 countries have adopted CDD projects in the hope that citizen empowerment translates to socio-economic development. But existing evidence is mixed, with some scholars arguing that CDD does not benefit the poor. This paper seeks to contribute to this literature by identifying any differentiated impact to the poor attributable to a CDD project in the Philippines. It draws on the literature on participatory budgeting to argue that participation of the socially excluded groups like the poor in the collective planning and budgeting determines the extent to which empowerment and democratization can be sustained. Using panel data collected in 2003 and 2010, the paper finds indications of elite control based on a decomposition of the profile of participants of village assemblies, which is a critical participatory institution in providing equal access to all members of the community to the deliberations and negotiations. The average participant of such village assemblies tend to be the less-poor household of the community with the participation of the poor dwindling over the years. The difference-in-difference impact estimation also reveals disappointing results for the poor. Although the project improved average household income among the poor, the project failed to enhance the social outcomes for the poor households such as participation in planning process, trust in the government and solidarity.

The technology in question is a small, portable palm oil expeller invented in Cameroon in the 1980 s. The technology was designed to increase the productivity of small farmers and create employment opportunities by increasing local capacity for small-scale palm oil processing. The expeller was subsequently promoted in Benin and Liberia over a period of nearly two decades. This evaluation is based on archival research of institutional records, data from impact surveys of technology users in all three countries during the project periods, and field research in Liberia in 2011 and 2013. The study analyzes and evaluates the social, economic, and environmental impacts of the expeller over the long term, comparatively, across a broad geographic area. In terms of social and economic impacts, the technology consistently increased incomes for farmers and small enterprises. The use of the technology altered relationships of production, particularly with regard to the role of women in palm oil processing and their control over resources. Environmental impacts of the technology are geographically dispersed and include increased water usage and pollution. Ultimately the technology in question has also contributed to political impacts over time by exacerbating conflicts between small farmers, palm oil corporations, and governments.

Those arguments emphasize the existence of higher involuntary underemployment among the poor and the fact that the type of work provided by these schemes gives disutility, deterring non-poor households from participating. To include these features, the consumption-based welfare metric used in past assessments of workfare schemes in underemployed developing countries is generalized to incorporate a welfare loss from casual manual work, while allowing the government to independently value the work done for other reasons. Using data for India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), the paper shows that the policy ranking switches in favor of a basic-income guarantee (BIG) over workfare. Allowing for a welfare loss from casual manual labor implies a more “poor-poor” targeting performance, but this is not sufficient to compensate for the direct welfare loss from the work requirement for plausible parameter values.

A review,"['Bellemare, Marc F.', 'Bloem, Jeffrey R.']","Although many urban areas around the world have grown steadily in recent years, the structural transformation, wherein an economy goes from relying primarily on agriculture and natural resources to relying primarily on manufacturing, has eluded many developing countries. In those countries, contract farming, whereby processors contract out the production of some agricultural commodity to growers, is often seen as a means of spurring the development of an agribusiness sector, and thus launch the structural transformation. As a result, economists and other social scientists have extensively researched contract farming over the last 30 years. We review the findings of the economics literature on contract farming and discuss its implications for development policy and research. In so doing, we highlight the methodological weaknesses that limit much of the literature on contract farming in answering questions of relevance for policy. Despite valiant research effort, many of the core features of contract farming imply substantial challenges for researchers aiming to study the question “Does contract farming improve welfare?” We conclude with a discussion of where we see the literature on contract farming evolving over the next few decades.",102,5,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:112:y:2018:i:c:p:259-271,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.08.018,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v112y2018icp259-271.html,2020-03-09 19:37:49," 2018, Volume 112, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
496,Reforming grants to tackle child poverty: An integrated macro-micro approach,"['Tiberti, Luca', 'Maisonnave, Helene', 'Chitiga, Margaret', 'Mabugu, Ramos']","Social grant schemes have become an important component of many developing countries’ inclusive growth strategies with governments increasingly investing in large-scale cash transfer programs. South Africa’s Child Support Grant (CSG) is one of the largest cash transfer systems in Africa. However, child poverty remains high in the country, leading to calls to expand the CSG. Government faces resource scarcity and therefore needs to create fiscal space to set up such a reform. This paper evaluates the economy-wide impact of the CSG on the economy using a recursive bottom-up/top-down CGE-micro simulation approach. This allows the estimation of the potential effects of a 20% increase in the grant on households’ welfare, the economy, as well as on the fiscal constraint. This reform is evaluated under three fiscal scenarios to take into account the fiscal stress the country is currently experiencing. We find that the reform brings some positive impacts at the macro level, and a decrease in poverty for the whole population as well as for children. The direct effect brought by the CSG increase represents the largest contribution to poverty reduction, but the indirect (general equilibrium) effects globally reduce the positive poverty effects engendered by the CSG. Some interesting heterogeneous effects are also found, with the proposed reform being progressive and the richest percentiles showing a (small) deterioration due to the decrease in wage revenues. However, the overall poverty and inequality effects are small and unlikely to be robust. The paper’s results can assist South Africa, and indeed other African countries, calling for increased coverage of grants as well as exploring universal coverage.

Investigating theories of change processes in Myanmar,"['Forsyth, Tim']","Approaches to resilience to climate change can be socially exclusionary if they do not acknowledge diverse experiences of risks or socio-economic barriers to resilience. This paper contributes to analyses of resilience by studying how theories of change (ToC) processes used by development organizations might lead to social exclusions, and seeking ways to make these more inclusive. Adopting insights from participatory monitoring and evaluation, the paper first presents fieldwork from four villages in Myanmar to compare local experiences of risk and resilience with the ToCs underlying pathways to resilience based on building anticipatory, absorptive, and adaptive capacities. The paper then uses interviews with the development organizations using these pathways to identify how ToC processes might exclude local experiences and causes of risk, and to seek ways to make processes more inclusive. The research finds that development organizations can contribute to shared ToCs for resilience, but adopt tacitly different models of risk that reduce attention to more transformative socio-economic pathways to resilience. Consequently, there is a need to consider how resilience and ToCs can become insufficiently scrutinized boundary objects when they are shared by actors with different models of risk and intervention.",17,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:111:y:2018:i:c:p:13-26,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.06.023,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v111y2018icp13-26.html,2020-03-09 19:38:04," 2018, Volume 111, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

One topic that has drawn extensive scholarly attention is democratic institutions as a source of comparative advantage in international trade. Using a new data set that covers around 140 countries from 1962 to 2010, we find that on average, democratic countries have the comparative advantage in exporting differentiated products, which reflects lower transaction costs in trade and higher economic complexity. Echoing literature on electoral autocracy, we also make the distinction between different subtypes of authoritarian regimes. Similarly, authoritarian countries with electoral institutions have the comparative advantage in exporting differentiated products relative to other authoritarian countries, though the magnitude is much smaller and inconsistent over time.

Conservative households often prefer women to stay home, which correlates to female employment and decision-making autonomy, affecting female physical mobility and female nutrition. Finding a suitable indicator for conservative outlook is difficult as we typically lack household-level ‘value survey’. In the fast modernizing context of rural Bangladesh, wearing burqa (veil) is often perceived as an indicator of socially conservative outlook. Using this insight, we process the data from the second wave of the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS) for 2015 to test the statistically robust association between household-level conservative outlook and gender-sensitive wellbeing indicators such as female employment, body mass index, and decision-making autonomy for the population of ever-married females aged 15–49 years old. After controlling for individual, household, and regional characteristics, and using sub-regional fixed effects, our findings suggest that living in conservative households is associated with lower probability of female employment. Females from conservative households are less likely to be in wage work or salaried jobs. The probability of being overweight is also higher for the females in conservative households as compared to non-conservative households.",9,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:111:y:2018:i:c:p:41-58,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.06.017,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v111y2018icp41-58.html,2020-03-09 19:38:12," 2018, Volume 111, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

In this paper, we revisit the aid-migration link using a substantially extended and adjusted econometric approach based on a gravity model of international migration. In contrast to the previous literature, we obtain evidence of a negative relationship between the total aid a country receives and emigration rates. This even holds for the poorer part of recipient countries, which suggests that the budgetary constraint channel does not play a significant role in shaping migration decisions. The most plausible explanation for these contrasting results is that, unlike in previous studies, we use migrant flows rather than migrant stocks as the dependent variable. In substantive terms, the limited importance of the budgetary constraint channel might reflect that positive welfare effects of foreign aid tend to manifest themselves in improved public services for the poor rather than higher incomes, which is in line with the reorientation of foreign aid towards social sectors under the Millennium Development Goals.",33,6,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:111:y:2018:i:c:p:59-74,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.06.021,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v111y2018icp59-74.html,2020-03-09 19:38:15," 2018, Volume 111, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
503,Re-politicizing participation or reframing environmental governance? Beyond indigenous’ prior consultation and citizen participation,"['Merino, Roger']","Recent studies explore how participatory mechanisms such as prior consultation/consent processes and participation in Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) might reinforce the mediating role of the state between social groups and companies at the same time that creates political opportunities for promoting social demands. This article problematizes these ideas by deepening the understanding of participatory mechanisms within broader environmental governance structures. The focus of the article is Peru, the first Latin American country that has passed a General Law of prior consultation for indigenous peoples, and currently is struggling to articulate this mechanism to participatory stages in EIAs. From an engagement with the literature on political ecology and development studies, this article explores the limitations of indigenous participation within an environmental governance that prioritize the promotion of investments in extractive industries. In particular, by exploring the challenges and limitations of indigenous decision-making power in new institutions for consultation and EIA participation, the article holds that participatory mechanisms themselves are unable to provide more power of decision to indigenous peoples if policy-makers translate claims for institutional transformation (related to indigenous self-determination and ecological zoning) into merely participatory provisions of specific projects. The result is a paradoxical multiplication of weak participatory channels, making the voices of local communities and indigenous peoples auditable, however, without a real compromise to translate these concerns into public policies beyond participatory processes.

Used primarily in psychology, the RAI measures the extent to which an individual’s actions are intrinsically or extrinsically motivated, where higher scores indicate greater autonomy. On aggregate, we find differences between men and women, and across countries, in the significance of association between the individual’s level of participation in decision-making and autonomy.

506,Historical legacies of colonial indirect rule: Princely states and Maoist insurgency in central India,"['Mukherjee, Shivaji']","What are the long term effects of colonial institutions on insurgency? The literature on civil wars has not explored the historical legacies of colonial institutions for insurgency. I address this gap in the literature, by exploiting sub-national variation in the most important internal security threat in the world's largest democracy—the Maoist insurgency in India. Within India, I focus on the crucial case of the Maoist rebels in the tribal state of Chhattisgarh in central India which epitomizes the causal mechanism of indirect rule through native princely states creating enclaves of weak state capacity, low development and tribal grievances due to natural resource exploitation. I test my theory on a new dataset at the sub district level within Chhattisgarh, and use instrumental variable regression to address endogeneity due to selection bias, combined with historical analysis and interview data to demonstrate path dependence. This study demonstrates historical origins of weak state capacity and ethnic grievances due to natural resource exploitation, which are important explanations for civil war onset. It also sets the agenda for further research on other cases where colonial indirect rule creates conditions for insurgency, like the Taliban in FATA in Pakistan, the ethnic insurgencies in Burma's peripheries, and leftist insurgencies in Nepal, Peru and Colombia.",26,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:111:y:2018:i:c:p:113-129,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.06.013,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v111y2018icp113-129.html,2020-03-09 19:38:30," 2018, Volume 111, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Land property rights are key determinants for reducing poverty through agricultural productivity, natural resource management, and socio-economic inequalities. Growing competition for land access increases the sensitivity in land socio-economic stakes and related policies in developing countries. This paper analyzes the impacts of land rights on land-related investment in rural Burkina Faso. We use rural representative panel data and appropriate methods. The Two-Stage Conditional Maximum Likelihood approach is used for dealing with endogeneity, while the Generalized Structural Equation Model allows us to control for random effects. We show that stronger land rights increase land-attached investment, and land investment has positive and negative effect on stronger and weaker land rights, respectively, in rural Burkina Faso. Our study also finds that women and immigrants have less land rights than men and natives, respectively. Our contribution to related literature includes the use of rigorous process of hierarchy in land rights. The close link of the results with land right strength is of great interest for cautious practitioners in land tenure and investment.

508,Assessing the global poverty effects of antimicrobial resistance,"['Ahmed, Syud Amer', 'Barış, Enis', 'Go, Delfin S.', 'Lofgren, Hans', 'Osorio-Rodarte, Israel', 'Thierfelder, Karen']","As a result of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), economies will experience an increase in mortality, reduced productivity for labor and the livestock sector, and increased health care costs. This paper assesses the potential global poverty impacts of AMR using a unique macro-micro framework. To estimate poverty effects of AMR, price, wage, and employment results from a dynamic, multi-country, multi-sector computable general equilibrium CGE model are used in a microsimulation model that integrates household surveys from 104 countries. The analysis in this paper advances other studies of AMR in two ways: (1) it links macro results to a microsimulation model to provide insight on poverty impacts for the world economy and countries of different income levels; and (2) it uses a global multi-sector model, rather than an aggregate global model, to generate macroeconomic results with structural details for capturing the economy-wide impact within countries and the spread across countries via trade flows. Relative to a world without AMR, the progression of antimicrobial resistance is expected to make it more difficult to eliminate extreme poverty, potentially adding 24.1 million people to become extremely poor, of whom 18.7 million live in low-income countries. The expected losses during 2015–50 may sum to $85 trillion in gross domestic product and $23 trillion in global exports (in present value). By 2050, the global gross domestic product could deviate negatively by 3.8 percent from the baseline (in the worst-case scenario considered). Because it is a global public bad, the optimal policy response will require global cooperation. The poverty outcomes induced by AMR in all country groups will deteriorate with short-sighted isolationist policies. Moreover, assistance from high-income countries to improve the economic resiliency of lower-income countries will also benefit the higher-income countries and world economy in general.",22,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:111:y:2018:i:c:p:148-160,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.06.022,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v111y2018icp148-160.html,2020-03-09 19:38:37," 2018, Volume 111, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

This suggests that such “hidden” forms of human capital may serve as critical targets for interventions aimed at altering young women’s educational and economic trajectories.

Using a dataset covering more than 400 Paris Club agreements, this paper fills that gap.

The progressive introduction of new terms of treatment gradually turned the Paris Club from an institution primarily concerned with preserving creditors’ claims into an instrument to foster development in the world’s poorer nations, among other objectives. Our study finds that more generous restructuring conditions involving nominal relief are associated with an acceleration of per capita GDP growth and with a reduction in poverty and inequality.

Impacts of formal insurance and crowding out of informal insurance","['Geng, Xin', 'Janssens, Wendy', 'Kramer, Berber', 'van der List, Marijn']","Health insurance can improve health-seeking behaviors and protect consumption from health shocks but may also crowd out informal insurance. This paper therefore examines whether impacts of health insurance depend on households’ access to informal insurance, as proxied for by mobile money usage. Based on high-frequency financial diaries data collected in rural Kenya, we find that households with weaker access to informal insurance cope with uninsured health shocks by lowering subsequent non-health expenditures by approximately 25 percent. These same households are able to smooth consumption when health shocks are insured, due to lower out-of-pocket health expenditures. In contrast, households with access to informal insurance are able to smooth consumption even in the absence of formal health insurance. For this latter group, health insurance increases healthcare utilization at formal clinics and does not crowd out gifts and remittances during weeks with health shocks. These findings provide guidance for insurance schemes aiming to target the most vulnerable populations.",36,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:111:y:2018:i:c:p:196-210,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.07.004,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v111y2018icp196-210.html,2020-03-09 19:38:48," 2018, Volume 111, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Our methodology addresses typical issues that arise when estimating network effects: reverse causality, common unobserved factors, and self-selection. In particular, we instrument the size of networks by predicting the number of migrants in each location using the location’s accessibility by distinct methods of transportation and information about how migrants from each country initially arrived in Spain. Our findings show that immigrants from above-average remitting countries remit more if they live in larger networks. For a subset of countries that receive large remittance flows from Spain, we show that migrants in larger networks are less likely to use most expensive remittance channels, and that cost spreads between the most expensive and cheapest remittance service provider are lower for countries characterized by stronger networks.

These have had a mixed record, and many have been widely critiqued. Nonetheless, schemes that were initiated under colonialism have been rehabilitated and new schemes are still being developed. This paper interrogates the continuing attraction of this model for irrigation, asking how and why it persists. Is the fact that engineering is so central to irrigation schemes another example of ‘high modernism’, as Scott might argue? Analysis of the history and current policy-making context of a new irrigation scheme in Malawi suggests a picture that is more complex, in which practical engineering considerations combine with narratives of modernisation and political imperatives to create momentum and lock-in.

Drawing on data from the World Health Organization for 62 countries, covering the period 2000–2014, we explore whether economic (risk of expropriation) and health (complete cause of death registries) institutions explain mortality rates and access to healthcare. To identify this relationship, we use settler mortality and the distance of the capital from the nearest major port – factors associated with institutional arrangements – to explain cross-national variation in health outcomes and the universality of health systems. We find that inclusive institutions arrangements – that protect and acknowledge the rights of citizens – are associated with better health outcomes (e.g. lower infant mortality and lower maternal mortality) as well as with better health systems (e.g. more skilled birth attendance and greater immunization).

However, the existing applications of classical Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition face criticism for their imprecise understanding of the factors affecting institutional discrimination in labor markets, as well as for their lack of power in formulating well-targeted anti-discrimination policies. Following Oaxaca (1973), we propose a new method to decompose the total discrimination index (TDI) to analyze employment and wage discrimination in the labor markets of developing countries. The TDI is decomposed into the employment discrimination index (EDI) and the wage discrimination index (WDI), then into the underpayment index to majorities (UPI) and the overpayment index to minorities (OPI). We apply this method to the institutional discrimination against rural migrants in China’s urban areas. Using national representative data from 2002 to 2013, we have found that, 1) the TDI increased quickly after China entered the WTO, then dropped after anti-discrimination policies were implemented. 2) The TDI is mainly determined by the UPI, while the TDI’s fluctuation is mainly determined by the WDI.

Countries with higher levels of corruption experience a significantly smaller drop in AIDS deaths as a result of the same quantity of ARVs imported. This is robust to different measures of corruption and to a measure of overall death rates as well as HIV-specific death rates as the outcome.

In coffee value chains, upgrading opportunities are presented by the growth in consumption of specialty coffees, which are associated with direct engagement with producer communities by roasting firms, along with an apparent increased commitment to social responsibility. Known in the industry as “relationship coffee”, such interventions align with a value chain approach to development and are promoted as offering upgrading opportunities for otherwise marginalized rural communities. In this article, we critique the dominant development discourse of relationship coffee in Indonesia via three case studies of livelihoods and local agrarian dynamics across three coffee-growing communities on the islands of Sulawesi, Bali and Java. We find that the relationship coffee model does present opportunities for producer upgrading. However, these benefits have been subsequently captured by key individuals within the producer community who are able to accumulate wealth and consolidate their social position. As it is currently implemented in Indonesia, the relationship coffee model has reproduced local patterns of inequality rather than contributing to poverty alleviation efforts.

The resulting development of these sectors leads to overall faster economic growth. A system of effectively multiple exchange rates is required when spillovers across different tradable sectors differ. The impact of RER policies is increased when they are complemented by traditional industrial policies that increase the elasticity of the aggregate supply to the RER. Among the instruments required to implement a stable and competitive RER are interventions in the foreign exchange market and regulation of capital flows.

To establish a causal inference, I merge village-level rainfall data with a child-level longitudinal survey—the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey—and apply a Correlated Random Effect quantile regression for panel data model. The findings suggest that a standard deviation increase in a village-level precipitation z-score has heterogeneous effects across the weight-for-height and weight-for-age z-score distributions and gender. The positive effects are more pronounced at the lower end of health status distributions and on girls. To the extent that the increase in a village-level precipitation z-score increases investment in child nutrition, its stronger effect on girls and at the lower end of the health status distribution implies that policy interventions that aim to promote nutritional investment reduces the health inequality gap across health status and gender.",25,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:63-74,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.018,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp63-74.html,2020-03-09 19:39:29," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Focusing on the transfer of policies and experiences (particularly conjoined demand management-free basic water programs and related social contestation), we provide examples of how neoliberal logics and human right to water principles intersect in evolving hybrid regulatory landscapes, which are characterized by contradiction. The human right to water makes a difference by influencing the drafting and implementation of water-related policies that affect to the lives of poor and vulnerable populations. Yet this process unfolds unevenly, as human right to water principles and practices are contextually applied, often alongside neoliberalizing policy instruments within evolving regulatory landscapes. Our analysis reveals the uneven effects of policy experimentation, transfer, and adaptation.

524,A poverty dynamics approach to social stratification: The South African case,"['Schotte, Simone', 'Zizzamia, Rocco', 'Leibbrandt, Murray']","The wave of upbeat stories on the developing world’s emerging middle class has reinvigorated a debate on how social class in general and the middle class in particular ought to be defined and measured. In the economics literature, most scholars agree that being middle class entails being free from poverty, which means being able to afford the basic things in life – not only today, but also tomorrow. In consequence, there is an increasing tendency to define the middle class based on a lack of vulnerability to poverty. In this paper, we strengthen and expand on these existing approaches in three ways: First, we incorporate the differentiation between the middle class and a (non-poor) vulnerable group into a broader social-stratification schema that additionally differentiates between transient and chronic poverty. Second, in estimating the risk of poverty, we employ a multivariate regression model that explicitly allows for possible feedback effects from past poverty experiences and accounts for the potential endogeneity of initial conditions, unobserved heterogeneity, and non-random panel attrition – four factors insufficiently addressed in existing studies. Third, we highlight the value of paying attention to these conceptual and modelling issues by showing that class divisions based on monetary thresholds inadequately capture a household’s chances of upward and downward mobility. We then apply our conceptual framework to the South African case. We find that only one in four South Africans can be considered stably middle class or elite. Access to stable labor market income is a key determinant of achieving economic stability. A lack of jobs as well as the prevalence of precarious forms of work drive high levels of vulnerability, which in turn constrains the development of an emergent middle class – not only in South Africa but potentially also in other parts of the developing world that face similar labor market challenges.",19,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:88-103,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.024,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp88-103.html,2020-03-09 19:39:37," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
525,"Effects of public policy on child labor: Current knowledge, gaps, and implications for program design","['Dammert, Ana C.', 'de Hoop, Jacobus', 'Mvukiyehe, Eric', 'Rosati, Furio C.']","Household decisions about child labor are influenced by income, uncertainty, and relative returns to work and education. The complexity of the phenomenon implies that a large set of policy instruments can be used to address child labor or can affect child labor. This review of 33 impact evaluations provides a comprehensive look at pathways through which social protection (credit and microfinance, cash transfers, vouchers, food programs), and labor programs affect child labor. Despite the complexity of integrating findings across different child labor definitions, implementation contexts, and policy instruments, some patterns emerge. For example, programs that address child labor by reducing the vulnerability of the household produce the desired effect. Transfers reduced child labor in most cases. Similarly, programs that help the household cope with exposure to risk, for example, health insurance, reduce household reliance on child labor. On the other hand, policies aimed at increasing adult household members’ participation in the labor market or entrepreneurial activities, can generate demand for adolescent and child work. Of course, such programs are an important component of anti-poverty strategies, but they could be modified and integrated with additional interventions to ensure that they do not produce adverse effects on child labor. While progress has been made over the past decade, there is still much to learn about the effects of public policy on the labor participation of many children in developing countries.",76,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:104-123,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.001,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp104-123.html,2020-03-09 19:39:41," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
526,Why education is not helping the poor. Findings from Uganda,"['Datzberger, Simone']","Education emerged as a nearly uncontested development strategy to tackle several forms of social, political, economic and geographic inequalities in low- and middle-income countries. When it comes to the case of Uganda, the country represents a striking paradox. Significant investments and policy reforms in education (such as Universal Primary and Secondary Education) since 1997, did not translate into the expected results with regards to poverty reduction through human capital investment. Progress in poverty alleviation is not only stagnant but the role of education therein can be described as ‘modest’ at best. Against this backdrop, this article assesses the following research question: Why did Uganda’s investments and policy reforms in education not uplift the poor? In examining the issue, this article introduces a theoretical framework that contrasts assimilative with transformative approaches in poverty alleviation through education. A rigorous review of Uganda’s education sector plans revealed that current strategies to reduce poverty revolve around a strong assimilation-based development agenda, thereby focusing on three main areas of intervention: (a) increased access to education and retention; (b) improved quality of education; and (c) employment generation through education. The article finds that these assimilative approaches do not have an impact on the political, economic and social structures that cause poverty in the first place. Hence, it concludes that assimilative models in education are highly dependent on transformative approaches. Concretely, change cannot emerge only at the very grassroots level, i.e. through educating society at large, but also has to arise from the systemic level, i.e. government institutions at the local, national and global levels. Methodologically, the analysis draws on qualitative data that was collected in the course of two extensive field research stays in 2015 and 2017. In addition, quantitative data in the form of statistical abstracts inform the analysis.",9,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:124-139,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.022,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp124-139.html,2020-03-09 19:39:44," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
527,From corn to popcorn? Urbanization and dietary change: Evidence from rural-urban migrants in Tanzania,"['Cockx, Lara', 'Colen, Liesbeth', 'De Weerdt, Joachim']","There is rising concern that the ongoing wave of urbanization will have profound effects on eating patterns and increase the risk of nutrition-related non-communicable diseases. Yet, our understanding of urbanization as a driver of changes in food consumption remains limited. Data from the Tanzania National Panel Survey, which tracked out-migrating respondents, allow us to compare individuals’ dietary patterns before and after they relocated from rural to urban areas and assess whether those changes differ from household members who stayed behind or moved to a different rural area. Our study shows that moving to an urban area does not have any significant effect on the intake of fats, animal-source foods, and dietary diversity. However, individuals who moved to urban areas do experience a more pronounced shift away from the consumption of traditional staples, and towards high-sugar, more conveniently consumed and prepared foods. These effects occur across the whole spectrum of urban locations, ranging from smaller secondary towns to large cities. Further exploring the factors underlying these changes in dietary patterns upon moving, we demonstrate that – depending on the food category considered – a substantial part of the impact of relocating to an urban area is related to the transition out of farming, differences in food prices, and especially income changes. The latter appears to explain the more pronounced growth of unhealthy food consumption after rural-urban migration. As such, health concerns over diets can be expected to spread to less urbanized areas as soon as income growth takes off there. Our findings call for more in-depth research on the extent and consequences of changes in diets related to living in more urbanized areas that may contribute to improved projections on food demand and help to improve health and food and nutrition security policies as well as agricultural and trade strategies.",35,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:140-159,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.04.018,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp140-159.html,2020-03-09 19:39:48," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Insights from performance-based financing in Sub-Saharan Africa,"['Gautier, Lara', 'Tosun, Jale', 'De Allegri, Manuela', 'Ridde, Valéry']","There has been growing interest in the diffusion of policy innovations across countries. Research on policy diffusion is characterised by coherent explanatory models that assess the importance of diffusion mechanisms. This study takes a different perspective on diffusion studies and advances public policy literature by introducing the concept of “diffusion entrepreneurs”. These entrepreneurs represent (groups of) individuals, networks, and organisations promoting a certain policy innovation with a view to gain influence. First, drawing from the diffusion literature and linking it to studies investigating policy diffusion in polycentric contexts, we introduce analytical categories to study diffusion entrepreneurs’ key features and actions. Second, to illustrate the analytical value of the concept, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the literature on the diffusion entrepreneurs of health performance-based financing (PBF) in Sub-Saharan Africa. We show how and why this recently diffused policy innovation provides a unique case for demonstrating our conceptual notion: in PBF, a nexus of strongly dedicated diffusion entrepreneurs have strived to induce policy diffusion. Specifically, we explore how the features of PBF diffusion entrepreneurs and their actions affect the outcomes of diffusion processes.

This paper considers the case of the cut flower industry in Ethiopia to provide such quantitative evidences. We collected workers’ primary data and conducted incentivized experiments to measure their cognitive abilities, risk preference, and other behavioral characteristics. Based on propensity-score matching and doubly robust estimations to facilitate rigorous comparisons, we find that production workers in the cut flower sector earn significantly more than similar workers in other sectors, most probably due to the flower farms’ interest to reduce costly worker turnovers. In addition, workers in the sector save more regularly than workers in other sectors who have similar characteristics, and the amount saved relative to the income level is also higher, after controlling for the frequency of wage payment and employment status. The subjective valuation of their jobs is also higher in the cut flower sector, particularly in terms of the income level, stability, and future prospect, but workers in the sector are not necessarily more satisfied with the type of work they do. Unlike other sectors where wage payment decreases with worker’s age, wage in the flower sector does not vary with age. Risk-averse individuals are more satisfied in the cut flower sector, while work experience reduces the satisfaction level on future prospect more in this sector relative to other sectors.",67,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:176-191,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.029,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp176-191.html,2020-03-09 19:39:56," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

A natural choice would be to adopt a fully nonparametric specification of the relationship in order to let the data reveal its nonlinearity. But, we would be faced with the problem of the curse of dimensionality due to the presence of many control variables in addition to income. Here, we first propose to estimate generalized additive models where only income is supposed to enter nonlinearly in the specification. Second, we use a recent cross-validation procedure in order to choose among various competing specifications including the parametric double-log specification widely used in the literature in addition to GAM specifications. This methodology is implemented for each of the six waves of the Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey from 2004 to 2014. The calorie-income relationship is nonlinear whatever the wave. A strong response of calorie intake to an increase in income for poorest households is highlighted, showing that there is still room for income-based policies to fight against malnutrition. A byproduct of this methodology is the decomposition of the evolution of average calorie intake between the two waves in the part due to population change and that coming from the change in calorie-income relationship, shedding new light on the nutritional transition in Vietnam.",33,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:192-204,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.030,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp192-204.html,2020-03-09 19:39:59," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Central to these debates is the question of whether and how aquaculture impacts local incomes and employment, yet little empirical evidence exists on the issue. To address this question, we propose a Local Economy-wide Impact Evaluation (LEWIE) model which nests fish farm models within a general-equilibrium model of their local economy. The model is calibrated using primary data collected from 1102 households in Myanmar’s main aquaculture zone, representative of 60% of the country’s aquaculture farms. Using this model, we examine the impact of aquaculture on the incomes and labor market outcomes of fish farming households, but also crop farms and non-farm households in the cluster. Simulating one-acre increases in pond/plot surface we find that: (1) aquaculture generates much higher incomes per-acre than agriculture; (2) aquaculture generates larger income spillovers than agriculture for non-farm households by way of retail and labor markets; (3) small commercial fish farms generate greater spillovers than large fish farms. These results bolster the notion that fish-farming, and in particular small-scale commercial aquaculture, may have a significant role to play in rural development and poverty reduction.",17,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:205-223,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.023,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp205-223.html,2020-03-09 19:40:03," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Theorists have long argued that media freedoms are necessary for democratic development, but effects on individual-level orientations and behaviors have not been fully explored. Specifically, there has been limited work on the effects of radio exposure on political participation in Africa, and individuals’ self-selection of the media they consume complicates the measurement of causal effects. However, the fact that access to FM radio signals is largely exogenously determined provides a possible identification strategy. Here, data on station technicalities and local topography are used to predict FM propagation in Uganda soon after the implementation of media liberalization. Analyses of results from an Afrobarometer survey demonstrate that radio exposure is significantly associated with higher self-reported political participation. With regard to mechanisms, there is no evidence that exposure is associated with significantly greater efficacy, interest in politics, attitudinal extremism, or perceptions about distributional politics or violence, but those who listened to the radio with greater frequency were more knowledgeable about politics.",33,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:224-242,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.002,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp224-242.html,2020-03-09 19:40:07," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
533,"Bloated bodies and broken bricks: Power, ecology, and inequality in the political economy of natural disaster recovery","['Sovacool, Benjamin K.', 'Tan-Mullins, May', 'Abrahamse, Wokje']","Disaster recovery efforts form an essential component of coping with unforeseen events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and typhoons, some of which will only become more frequent or severe in the face of accelerated climate change. Most of the time, disaster recovery efforts produce net benefits to society. However, depending on their design and governance, some projects can germinate adverse social, political, and economic outcomes. Drawing from concepts in political economy, political ecology, justice theory, and critical development studies, this study first presents a conceptual typology revolving around four key processes: enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment. Enclosure refers to when disaster recovery transfers public assets into private hands or expands the roles of private actors into the public sphere. Exclusion refers to when disaster recovery limits access to resources or marginalizes particular stakeholders in decision-making activities. Encroachment refers to when efforts intrude on biodiversity areas or contribute to other forms of environmental degradation. Entrenchment refers to when disaster recovery aggravates the disempowerment of women and minorities, or worsens concentrations of wealth and income inequality within a community. The study then documents the presence of these four inequitable attributes across four empirical case studies: Hurricane Katrina reconstruction in the United States, recovery efforts for the 2004 tsunami in Thailand, Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines, and the Canterbury earthquakes in New Zealand. It next offers three policy recommendations for analysts, program managers, and researchers at large: spreading risks via insurance, adhering to principles of free prior informed consent, and preventing damage through punitive environmental bonds.

534,Constitutional economics of Ghana’s decentralization,"['Frimpong Boamah, Emmanuel']","This paper concerns the rules that are often chosen to frame decentralization in Ghana. It perceives the challenges of multi-level governance in postcolonial sub-Saharan African countries, such as weak local government capacity for urban planning, as effects of ill-conceived constitutional rules. The paper draws ideas from constitutional political economy (CPE) to problematize the constitutional rules underlying Ghana’s current state of decentralization. I argue that these constitutional rules, embodied in Ghana’s 1992 Constitution and Local Government Act (462), evince both continued dominance of state control over local governance and a systemic transfer of the logics and instruments of the authoritarian Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) military regime to the choice of constitutional rules for Ghana’s decentralization. In other words, Ghana’s decentralization patterns and processes must be examined in the context of the constitutional regime from which they were born. One such pattern is the creation of new local governments (a gerrymandering strategy) by successive governments without commensurate improvement in local democratic and pro-poor developmental outcomes. The paper’s discussions, largely conceptual but interlaced with empirical moments, serve to stimulate debate about the relationships between the constitutional rules for decentralization and their socioeconomic and political effects. I conclude by reflecting on the conceptual and methodological challenges of using CPE to analyze constitutional rules for decentralization and offer ideas to address these challenges in future research.",16,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:256-267,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.036,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp256-267.html,2020-03-09 19:40:14," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
535,Does rural development aid reduce international migration?,"['Gamso, Jonas', 'Yuldashev, Farhod']","In recent years, interest has emerged in policy circles and among academics about the use of foreign aid to reduce international migration. Scholars have investigated this aid-migration nexus, but results have been mixed and questions remain. This paper contributes to the literature by comparing the effects of rural and urban development aid on international migration. Specifically, we hypothesize that while increases in rural development aid to developing countries reduce emigration from those countries, greater urban aid produces the opposite effect – higher rates of emigration. These hypotheses are informed by two theoretical mechanisms. The first mechanism focuses on the divergent preferences of rural and urban populations regarding emigration. Aid targeting these respective populations provides each with resources to follow through on their migratory ambitions, or lack thereof. The second mechanism focuses on contrasting impacts of rural and urban aid on agricultural sector development and the effects of this sort of development on emigration. We analyze cross-national time series data to test our hypotheses regarding rural and urban development aid, finding that countries that receive larger amounts of rural development aid have lower emigration rates. Then we turn to survey data from the Arab Barometer to assess whether the attitudes of survey respondents match our theorized mechanisms. Results from survey data suggest that investments in agricultural sector capacity building will lead to reductions in emigration from developing countries; however, these findings do not indicate that rural and urban populations differ in terms of their desire to emigrate.",30,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:268-282,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.035,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp268-282.html,2020-03-09 19:40:18," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

We argue that the two types of aid may respond differently to security challenges because of donors’ disparate objectives and aid-giving motives. The results show that armed conflict reduces the amounts of obtained aid of all types, conditional on a country being an aid recipient. Multilateral donors are also less likely to include a conflict-ridden country on a recipient list. Domestic terrorism increases bilateral aid, but this effect appears to be entirely driven by assistance from the United States, arguably a terrorist prime-target country. When we disaggregate aid flows by their purposes, we find that international and domestic terrorism are associated with increases in bilateral aid for promotion of governance, education, health and society.",56,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:283-294,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.06.009,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp283-294.html,2020-03-09 19:40:21," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Even though poverty today remains predominantly a rural phenomenon, there is a need to better understand the landscape of poverty in urban areas. Drawing on small-area estimation methods we estimate welfare outcomes at the level of individual towns and cities in Vietnam, including even the smallest towns. Such estimates could not be produced using national sample surveys alone. Results show an inverse relationship between poverty and city size in Vietnam, with the urban poor being disproportionately concentrated in small towns and cities. This relationship is robust to the location of the poverty line as well as to alternative city-size definitions. Interestingly, our evidence of a clear gradient between absolute poverty and city size is not replicated for subjective welfare, measured by self-reported food sufficiency. The absolute poverty-city size gradient does, however, accord with the observation of striking variation in service availability across cities of different size in Vietnam. Small town residents are typically confronted with far lower per-capita availability of basic services than are large city dwellers. The results suggest that policymakers concerned to tackle urban poverty in Vietnam should not neglect attending to smaller towns.

Transfers from teacher surplus schools to deficit schools within a 10 km radius in Haryana, a state of India for which we have geo-coded location of schools in 2013, enables 19 percent of deficit schools to meet the minimum requirement. We use the mandated norms in the Right to Education Act in India, to define deficit and surplus schools. In the process we also provide a characterization of schools that are in deficit and those in surplus. We find that connectedness, the social composition of the enrolled students, the income of the neighborhood are important determinants of a school being in deficit. Surplus schools mirror the results on deficit, but not always so: they are far more heterogenous, leading to possibilities that they may in fact be no different than some low shortage deficit schools. Keeping in the background this heterogeneity in surplus schools, we design local transfers between schools and evaluate them on how well they match characteristics of the donor and recipient schools. The chosen algorithm is compared to another transfer rule that reduces the variance of shortages across schools and is found to be better in matching characteristics, that is, the donor and recipient schools are, on an average, matched in characteristics: in terms of the development of the region, its rural/urban location, connectivity and school characteristics.

However, research on local climate perceptions to date has tended to focus on what changes are perceived, not on how those changes are interpreted in particular socio-cultural contexts and given meaning within local worldviews and systems of values and beliefs. Based on fieldwork in agro-pastoral communities in highland Cusco, Peru, this study examines climate perceptions in terms of how local community members understand and explain changing climatic conditions. Specifically, two local climate narratives are identified and found to relate to Andean re-interpretations of Catholic and Evangelical religious traditions. The Andean practice of ritual offering to the earth (pago a la tierra) is found to play a key role both in the shifting religious identifications encountered at the local level, and in giving meaning to changing climatic conditions. The article further explores how these perspectives are rooted in diverging ontological and epistemological foundations. While in the local Catholic view the earth is conceived of as a non-human sacred/social person (pachamama or Santa Tierra) with whom a relationship of reciprocity must be maintained, the local Evangelical perspective instead conceives of the earth as an object, not a subject, more closely mirroring modernist Nature/Culture dualism. More broadly, the study suggests that how people interpret changing climatic conditions cannot simply be extracted and purified from the contexts of meaning production, and proposes the concept of ‘entangled narratives’ as a way of accounting for the social and cultural embeddedness of climate perceptions. Fulfilling our obligation to address climate change in socially just ways will require deepening our understanding of its human dimensions, including taking seriously what these changes may mean to the impacted groups.",10,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:345-359,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.06.012,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp345-359.html,2020-03-09 19:40:40," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
542,Politicising inequality: The power of ideas,"['Evans, Alice']","A contemporary challenge is inequality. This paper illustrates why ideas matter, and how they can change over time. Inequalities are reinforced when they are taken for granted. But this can be disrupted when marginalised people gain self-esteem; challenge hitherto unquestioned inequalities; and gain confidence in the possibility of social change. Slowly and incrementally, social mobilisation can catalyse greater government commitment to socially inclusive economic growth. This is illustrated with ethnographic research from Latin America, where income inequality has recently declined. Clearly, however, no single paper can provide a comprehensive account of political change in an incredibly diverse region. By highlighting some ways in which ideas matter (and the limitations of alternative hypotheses about increased fiscal space and democratisation), this paper merely seeks to persuade political economists to go beyond ‘incentives’. Future efforts to tackle inequality might harness the power of ideas: tackling ‘norm perceptions’ (beliefs about what others think and do); publicising positive deviance; and strengthening social movements.",25,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:360-372,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.06.006,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp360-372.html,2020-03-09 19:40:43," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
543,Maternity protection in formal and informal economy workplaces: The case of Ghana,"['Stumbitz, Bianca', 'Lewis, Suzan', 'Kyei, Abigail A.', 'Lyon, Fergus']","Maternity protection (MP) in the workplace is a vital element of ensuring women’s and children’s wellbeing. It aims to minimize the difficulties that working women face because of giving birth and to protect the health of mothers and their babies. Most research on MP around the world is carried out in larger organizations in developed countries. This cannot be applied uncritically to developing countries, where work in small firms and the informal economy tends to dominate and enterprises are more influenced by their local communities and environment. This paper explores different forms of MP found in various forms and sizes of enterprise in Ghana. Specifically, it examines 1) how workplaces in the formal and informal economy manage MP and 2) how reciprocity shapes workers’ access to the different forms of MP support. The paper draws on 63 qualitative interviews with employers and women employees across three geographic regions of Ghana. The findings show that there are a range of measures related to pregnancy, maternity leave, family-friendly flexible working conditions, breastfeeding and childcare. While large formal economy organizations mostly offer MP measures corresponding to regulatory entitlements, women working in small informal economy businesses often only benefit from informal MP support. However, neither statutory nor informal supports alone provide adequately for women’s needs. The paper highlights the important roles of reciprocity and relationships built on trust as conditions for family-friendly MP provisions, particularly in the informal economy workplaces. It concludes by identifying lessons that can be learnt by both formal and informal economy businesses.",13,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:373-384,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.06.007,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp373-384.html,2020-03-09 19:40:47," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
544,How women’s incumbency affects future elections: Evidence from a policy experiment in Lesotho,"['Clayton, Amanda', 'Tang, Belinda']","How do women incumbents affect women’s future electoral success? Using causal evidence from a government-initiated policy experiment in Lesotho, in which districts reserved for women village councilors were first randomized and then withdrawn, we find that women win more frequently in previously reserved areas after the policy’s removal. We present evidence that this effect is driven by incumbent women’s electoral success in formerly reserved districts, as well as by new women candidates who are more likely to win in the absence of incumbent men. This occurs for two reasons: (1) new women candidates have more success against incumbent women than incumbent men and (2) women incumbents run for reelection less frequently than incumbent men, leaving more open seats. Contrary to previous work, we find no evidence that women incumbents increase the number of new women candidates in their districts, increase the vote share new women candidates receive, or increase party support for new women candidates. These findings suggest that, at least in the short term, women’s incumbency affects subsequent patterns of women’s representation by disrupting patterns of male incumbency rather than changing voters’ or parties’ demand for women candidates.",10,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:385-393,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.033,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp385-393.html,2020-03-09 19:40:51," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

To capture possible heterogeneity of effects, we use the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) for comparative case studies. The SCM allows to compare the trajectory of post-reform health outcomes of treated countries (those which experienced trade liberalization) with the trajectory of a combination of similar but untreated countries. On average, trade liberalization significantly reduced child mortality. The average reduction is around 9% ten years after the liberalization. But there is significant heterogeneity in the impact. For the cases for which the SCM could provide a reliable counterfactual, trade liberalization significantly reduced child mortality in approximately half the cases. In most other cases there was no significant effect. In the majority of the significant cases, the reduction in child mortality was more than 20%. On average, trade liberalization reduced child mortality more (a) in democracies compared to autocracies, (b) when incomes were higher and (c) when it reduced taxation of farmers.",62,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:394-410,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.034,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp394-410.html,2020-03-09 19:40:54," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
546,"Metering water: Analyzing the concurrent pressures of conservation, sustainability, health impact, and equity in use","['Cairns, Maryann R.']","This study focuses on the impacts of water and sanitation (WatSan) development with particular attention to how the technopolitical practice of water metering prompts critical discussion on the conflicting pressures of conservation, sustainability, health impact and equable access to water resources. The very act of metering is imbued with political and social expectations stemming from development organizations. The study utilizes a mixed-method approach, triangulating data from interviews, focus groups, surveys, participatory mapping, and participant observation over a period of two years. Data show that while metering regimes were designed by NGOs to ensure equal access, system sustainability and safety, and deforestation prevention (goals that community members supported), through both the meters’ presence as technological constructs and due to the cost of water as gauged by the meters the practice placed undue pressure on certain groups, including large families, students, renters, and households with low incomes or seasonal income shortages. In short, water metering served to delimit true and equal access to safe water. This calls into question the utility of the ubiquitous practice and the continued proliferation of water metering in WatSan development, especially in areas that are water-rich and already have non-capitalocentric and/or locally-generated water management and conservation practices, policies, and trainings (whether formal or informal). This discussion is useful as a window into the unforeseen and hidden aspects of implementing power-laden development technologies, such as metering, and the ways in which individuals may eschew such systems in passive ways that go unchecked by monitoring and evaluation schemas. Additionally, the work critically interrogates the pairing of metering with systems that require water to remove waste from households (e.g., through flush toilets) and the appropriate design of these systems.",17,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:411-421,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.06.001,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp411-421.html,2020-03-09 19:40:58," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

This review asks why addressing caste-based inequality and discrimination does not feature in intergovernmental commitments such as the Sustainable Development Goals, and whether it should. Taking India as its focus, it finds that caste has been treated as an archaic system and source of historical disadvantage due compensation through affirmative action in ways that overlook its continuing importance as a structure of advantage and of discrimination in the modern economy, especially post-liberalization from the 1990s. A body of recent literature from anthropology, economics, history and political science is used to explore the modern life of caste in society, economy and development. Questions are asked about caste as social hierarchy, the role of caste in post-liberalization rural inequality, in urban labor markets and in the business economy, and the effect of policies of affirmative action in public-sector education and employment. Caste is found to be a complex institution, simultaneously weakened and revived by current economic and political forces; it is a contributor to persisting national socioeconomic and human capital disparities, and has major impacts on subjective wellbeing. Caste effects are not locational; they travel from the village to the city and into virtually all markets. Caste persists in the age of the market because of its advantages – its discriminations allow opportunity hoarding for others; and the threat of the advancement of subordinated groups provokes humiliating violence against them. The evidence points to the need for policy innovation to address market and non-market discrimination and to remove barriers, especially in the informal and private sector; and to ensure caste has its proper place in the global development policy debate.",35,5,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:422-436,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.06.003,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp422-436.html,2020-03-09 19:41:02," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
548,Investing in land to change your risk exposure? Land transactions and inequality in a landslide prone region,"['Mertens, Kewan', 'Vranken, Liesbet']","The poor and vulnerable tend to be increasingly exposed to natural hazards such as landslides. Land markets are one of the channels through which farmers get exposed to such hazards. This paper investigates the consequences of land transactions for the (un)equal distribution of exposure to landslide risk and of total land holdings in a rural area in Western Uganda. We propose and empirically test a mechanism through which land holdings and exposure to landslide risk evolve over a farmer’s lifetime. A structured household survey and detailed information on land transaction as well as georeferenced information on plots was used to construct a panel dataset of land transactions. Regressions with household fixed effects were run to identify how landholdings and exposure to landslide susceptibility evolves over a farmer’s lifetime. We find that farmers that are initially more exposed to landslides manage to reduce their average exposure to some extent by acquiring plots outside landslide prone areas. This goes at a cost, as farmers that are initially highly exposed acquire land more slowly than farmers that have a lower exposure on their first plot. Over a lifetime, in our case study, land transactions therefore have a somewhat levelling effect on inequality in exposure to landslides, but increase the inequality in land ownership. As such, one of the ways through which unequal risk exposure contributes to propagating inequality in total land ownings is theoretical and empirically identified.",30,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:437-452,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.06.015,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp437-452.html,2020-03-09 19:41:06," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Debate continues on what domains constitute women’s empowerment and how to measure empowerment across countries. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are the most widely available source of data on women’s empowerment. However, measurement invariance often is assumed, but not tested. We used DHS data from Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda to test factor structure and measurement invariance of women’s empowerment among married women ages 15–49. Factor analysis confirmed a three-latent-domain model of women’s empowerment in each country capturing women’s human/social assets, gender attitudes related to wife abuse, and women’s participation in household decisions. Multi-country confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) identified an invariant three-factor model of women’s empowerment and a subset of country-specific items.

550,Gender and multidimensional poverty in Nicaragua: An individual based approach,"['Espinoza-Delgado, José', 'Klasen, Stephan']","Most existing multidimensional poverty measures, such as the global-MPI and the MPI-LA, use the household as the unit of analysis, which means that the multidimensional poverty condition of the household is equated with the multidimensional poverty condition of all its members; accordingly, these measures ignore the intra-household inequalities and are gender-insensitive. Gender equality is, however, at the center of the sustainable development, as emphasized by Goal 5 of the SDGs; therefore, individual-based measures are indispensable to track progress in reaching this Goal. We contribute to the literature on multidimensional poverty and gender inequality by proposing an individual-based multidimensional poverty measure for Nicaragua and estimate the gender gaps in the three I’s of multidimensional poverty (incidence, intensity, and inequality). Overall, we find that in Nicaragua, the gender gaps in multidimensional poverty are lower than 5%, and poverty does not seem to be feminized. However, the inequality among the multidimensionally poor is clearly feminized, especially among adults, and women are living in very intense poverty when compared to men. We also find that adding a dimension (employment, domestic work, and social protection) under which women face higher deprivation into the analysis leads to larger estimates of the incidence, intensity, and inequality of women’s poverty. Finally, we find evidence that supports earlier studies that challenge the notion that female-headed households are worse off than those led by males in terms of poverty.",106,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:110:y:2018:i:c:p:466-491,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.06.016,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v110y2018icp466-491.html,2020-03-09 19:41:13," 2018, Volume 110, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Further, we find that increasing the state's openness and competitiveness in the executive recruitment of leaders is the main channel through which political democratization promotes the role of banking and stock markets for financing innovation.

To assess the conventional view that assets uniformly improve childhood development through wealth effects, we use three waves of panel data from Tanzania and test whether different types of assets have differential effects on children’s educational outcomes. Our results indicate that household durables and housing quality have positive effects, but agricultural assets have adverse effects on children’s highest grade completed and exam performances. We use a Hausman-Taylor instrumental variable (HTIV) panel data estimator to identify the effects of both time-varying and time-invariant endogenous variables.

553,The Political Ecology of Oil Palm Company-Community partnerships in the Peruvian Amazon: Deforestation consequences of the privatization of rural development,"['Bennett, Aoife', 'Ravikumar, Ashwin', 'Paltán, Homero']","When agricultural commodities are traded globally, consumer demand in one region influences the crops planted in another, often leading to widespread environmental and social transformation at the production sites. As a commodity crop that prospers in tropical environments, oil palm has become controversial for its role as a driver of deforestation and social conflict, especially in main producer countries in Southeast Asia. As suitable land for oil palm production in Southeast Asia is depleting, companies have begun to look to new production frontiers, such as Latin America. Colombia and Peru have the highest percentage growth in the sector in recent years, and the crop has become a dominant strategy for development in the Peruvian Amazon. Between 2000 and 2015, 40,000 hectares of old growth forest have been cleared for large oil palm plantations in Peru. Company-Community partnerships (CCPs) have been advanced as a potentially more socially and environmentally sustainable strategy, through their alleged capacity to provide greater productivity and more efficient land use on smallholder farms. This paper describes the social, political and deforestation impact of an oil palm CCP at the forest frontier in the Peruvian Amazon. An interdisciplinary and mixed methods research approach was employed, including long-term ethnographic work and visual measurement remote sensing of land use change on 2447 hectares of smallholder land in four villages/communities. The results show that the recent arrival of powerful private companies has caused a major socio-ecological shift on the ground, particularly through the CCP. On comparing participating farms to non-participating farms, we find significant deforestation 'spillage' out of the plantation into participating farms. A major underlying driver of the negative outcomes of the CCP is the neoliberal policy approach employed by the Peruvian government, which has outsourced basic rural public works to private companies. We conclude by discussing how a more socially and environmentally just oil palm production strategy in Peru and elsewhere might look.",12,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:29-41,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.04.001,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp29-41.html,2020-03-09 19:41:25," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

556,The SDGs in middle-income countries: Setting or serving domestic development agendas? Evidence from Ecuador,"['Horn, Philipp', 'Grugel, Jean']","The expansion of middle-income countries in the global South is now widely acknowledged as significant for international development research and practice. But, as yet, scholars have not fully considered how middle-income countries are responding to the new global goals on international development (the Sustainable Development Goals – SDGs) outlined in Agenda 2030. Equally, insufficient attention has been paid to how – if at all – the SDGs shape domestic development policies and practices in middle income countries. We ask these questions in Ecuador, a country that recently moved from being a lower middle-income and donor dependent country to a more autonomous higher middle-income country with the capacity to promote its own national domestic development approach, Buen Vivir (in English: living well). Deploying a qualitative case study methodology and drawing primarily on in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with policy makers working in Ecuador’s national government and in the capital Quito, we show that policy makers’ engagement with the SDGs is selective, with an emphasis on those goals and targets which are considered of domestic importance. Both the national government and Quito’s local government are currently focussing mainly on SDGs 10.2 (breaking inequalities) and 11 (inclusive cities). We demonstrate that, in practice, how policy makers understand implementation of these “priority” goals is not consistent; it depends on political preferences, where policy makers are located in the architecture of decentralised governance and the context-specific challenges they face. Evidence from Ecuador suggests that the SDGs cannot be understood as a single coherent template for development that states will simply adopt. Rather they should be analysed in the context of a rapidly changing architecture of global power, shaped by the context-specific nature of national development challenges and national political structures, including decentralisation.",31,5,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:73-84,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.04.005,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp73-84.html,2020-03-09 19:41:36," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
557,What constrains renewable energy investment in Sub-Saharan Africa? A comparison of Kenya and Ghana,"['Pueyo, Ana']","Policymakers in Sub-Saharan Africa face several choices to increase levels of access to electricity under severe budget constraints. First, they need to prioritise technologies that can supply electricity at a low cost. Second, they need to design and implement appropriate policies to attract private investment. On the first choice, renewable energy is becoming increasingly competitive with fossil fuels. Moreover, it contributes to energy security and environmental sustainability, while providing access to new sources of (sustainable) finance. On the second choice, developing countries typically face a multitude of constraints to attract investment to their energy sector. It can be daunting and expensive to address them all at once. This paper presents a new methodology to support policymakers to better target policies for the promotion of commercial-scale renewable energy investment. The methodology, which we call “Green Investment Diagnostics” draws upon the Growth Diagnostics framework, extensively used in the field of Development Economics to identify the binding constraints to economic growth. It is operationalised with a decision tree analysis that builds cumulative evidence to prioritise some constraints over others, through the review of indicators and validation through expert interviews. We apply this approach to Kenya and Ghana, finding that Ghana’s key constraints to investment in renewable energy are an unreliable off-taker, macroeconomic imbalances, regulatory uncertainty, pressures to keep prices low, as well as insufficient and costly domestic finance. Kenya instead offers generous returns to investment in renewables but faces a low demand, a lack of networking infrastructure and problems of governance and social acceptance, exacerbated by uncertain land property rights and rent-seeking.",14,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:85-100,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.04.008,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp85-100.html,2020-03-09 19:41:39," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

What factors shape the effectiveness of policy implementation following reform decisions? These questions increasingly concern the international donor and research communities, given the importance of policy environments in shaping development outcomes and the growing need to achieve development impact with scarce resources. To address these questions, this paper introduces the Kaleidoscope Model of policy change. Inductively derived from empirical examples in developing countries, political economy literature, and theoretical scholarship on the policy process, the model proposes a set of 16 operational hypotheses to identify the conditions under which policies emerge on the agenda and ultimately are implemented. The paper tests the model empirically in Zambia by evaluating eight policy reform episodes related to agricultural input subsidies and vitamin A fortification.

Piped water services in India are generally in the former category, but efforts are underway in some cities to shift to continuous supply. We use a matched-cohort research design to evaluate one such effort: an upgrade to continuous water service in a pilot zone of Hubli-Dharwad, India, while the rest of the city remained on intermittent services. We conducted a survey of ∼4000 households with four rounds of data collection over 15 months. We evaluated the household-level net benefits, the equity of their distribution, and the affordability of water access under continuous supply. We also evaluated the project at the system-level (household and utility), estimating the net present value of the upgrade and the feasibility of scale-up to the entire city. We found positive net benefits for households overall, but uneven distribution of these benefits across socio-economic strata. We also found that the costs of supply augmentation, a necessary step for scale-up, significantly reduced the project net present value. The potential for scale-up is thus unclear.",8,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:121-133,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.04.011,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp121-133.html,2020-03-09 19:41:47," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
560,From state-initiated to Indigenous-driven infrastructure: The Inuvialuit and Canada’s first highway to the Arctic Ocean,"['Bennett, Mia M.']","Between 2010 and 2050, the world's combined road and rail network will grow an estimated 60%. National governments are building many of these roads, which are often perceived as disenfranchising Indigenous communities. Yet in the Canadian Arctic’s Mackenzie Delta, a joint venture between two Indigenous-owned construction and transportation companies built the first public highway in North America to the Arctic Ocean, which opened in November 2017. This research, based on qualitative fieldwork in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region where the highway was constructed, challenges ideas that roads are invariably top-down initiatives which negatively impact Indigenous peoples and their lands. Inuvialuit community leaders lobbied for this road project and succeeded in winning CAD $299 million in government funding to construct the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway. They leveraged opportunities afforded by land claims treaties and shifting geopolitics in the warming Arctic, which turned their region into a frontier of renewed national and global interest, to accumulate funding. Strategically, they discursively rescaled a road they sought to promote economic development and improve local mobility between two communities into a highway of national importance. This study thus extends work on tribal capitalism to explore the place-based dynamics of Indigenous political economies. It unpacks the scale-oriented strategies Indigenous peoples use to advocate for new roads and increased connectivity, finding that these discourses and practices can complement the state’s promotion of nation-building and market capitalism in frontier spaces. This research also suggests that more attention is required to the circumstances in which Indigenous peoples initiate or become partners in infrastructure development rather than examining only instances of resistance.",12,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:134-148,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.04.003,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp134-148.html,2020-03-09 19:41:50," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Darfur once commanded global attention but has receded into the shadows of a world suffering from compassion fatigue. This study was prompted by three distinct yet related concerns. The first is the growing interest in environmental performance within illiberal regimes. I contend that understanding the situation in authoritarian and heavily conflict-ridden societies such as Darfur region in Sudan requires a combined holistic and historical framework for understanding the complex interplay of political economy and cultural ecology affecting local use and management of natural resources. The second concern is a desire to reflect on the possibilities and challenges of peacebuilding and recovery Darfur, drawing on my experience there with two projects carried out by the Near East Foundation that sought to promote early recovery in Central Darfur through environmental peacebuilding. Its preparation was prompted by three distinct yet related concerns. The third concern is to address some of the links between peacebuilding and natural resource interventions. I argue that even in extremely illiberal settings such as Darfur that it is still possible to carry out activities that widen the scope for action by local populations. This finding was most evident regarding the project’s conflict management training, which local people ended up applying in a range of situations, and which helped spawn a peace movement among youths. Nevertheless, project participants noted that this training and action, while helpful at the community level, could not address “bigger problems outside.” Renewed national and international peace efforts are needed.",7,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:163-171,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.04.017,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp163-171.html,2020-03-09 19:41:58," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

This article examines the bindingness of village elections in China. Through the lens of land expropriation in peri-urban villages and using survey data, we find that institutional bindingness—operationalized in terms of the power structure within village leadership—strongly shapes the processes and outcomes of land expropriations and therefore the quality of village governance. Moreover, village power structure depends on political bargaining between ordinary villagers and local states. Our findings contribute to the understanding of quasi-democratic institutions in authoritarian regimes by explicitly examining how institutional bindingness affects governance outcomes and how bindingness is endogenously determined.",23,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:172-186,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.04.019,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp172-186.html,2020-03-09 19:42:01," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Permanent or temporary out-migration can provide an individual or family the opportunity to mitigate against these effects. One major challenge to quantifying the impact of climate change on out-migration is lack of appropriate spatial and temporal data. Out-migration data must be adequately detailed to include both long- and short-term departures. The climate data must provide fine scale, community-specific detail. To examine the climate variability as a factor of out-migration we examine individual- and community-level responses using highly detailed, full migration histories of 3150 individuals with fine-scale rainfall data. Using this multi-method approach we examine the probability of out-migration as well as out-migration duration and destination as they relate to locally measured rainfall.

Here, we ask: what is equitable resilience? Our focus is on what resilience does on the ground in relation to development, adaptation and disaster management, and on identifying critical issues for engaging with equity in resilience practice. Using techniques from systematic reviews, with variants of equitable resilience as our key search terms, we carried out an analytical literature review which reveals four interconnected themes: subjectivities, inclusion, cross-scale interactions, and transformation. Drawing on this analysis, we find that ‘equitable resilience’ is increasingly likely when resilience practice takes into account issues of social vulnerability and differential access to power, knowledge, and resources; it requires starting from people’s own perception of their position within their human-environmental system, and it accounts for their realities and for their need for a change of circumstance to avoid imbalances of power into the future. Our approach moves beyond debates that focus on the ontological disconnect between resilience and social theory, to provide a definition that can be used in practice alongside resilience indicators to drive ground level interventions towards equitable outcomes. Defined in this way, equitable resilience is able to support the development of social-ecological systems that are contextually rooted, responsive to change and socially just, and thus relevant to global sustainability challenges.",17,5,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:197-205,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.04.020,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp197-205.html,2020-03-09 19:42:09," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

This resulted in a gold mining boom, making gold the main export product and the main source of economic growth of the country. We hypothesize that gold extraction improved population living standards. This paper investigates how the gold boom in Burkina Faso which began in 2007 has affected socioeconomic outcomes. We use a simple theoretical model to motivate the testing of several hypotheses regarding these impacts. Employing a difference-in-differences strategy as well as panel data models, we estimate the impacts using data from household surveys undertaken in 2003 and 2009 and administrative data. Consistent with our model, the results suggest that areas hosting gold extraction have better average living standards in terms of headcount ratios, poverty gaps and household expenditures than do areas without gold. However, the gold boom is also shown to have potentially increased local inequality and child labor in areas with these income gains. These results demonstrate the importance of proactive government policy in mitigating negative welfare impacts.",29,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:206-221,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.04.021,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp206-221.html,2020-03-09 19:42:13," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Using an original county-level dataset from Maoist China, we demonstrate a strong and robust negative relationship exists between the scale of repression of intellectuals in the Anti-Rightist Campaign (ARC) in 1957–58 and economic productivity decades later. This fall in economic output is caused by the loss of already scarce human capital resulting from the violent political campaign. Until at least 2000, significant and robust negative correlations exist between the percentage of victims in a county and its populations’ level of educational achievement and economic performance. By demonstrating the negative relationship between the state’s purposeful destruction of human capital for political reasons and long-run economic growth, we are able to add China to a growing body of research on the long-run deleterious effects of state-sponsored political repression against intellectuals.

We re-examine the relationship between taxation, non-tax revenue and democracy by employing dramatically improved data developed specifically for this research. We find the strongest evidence to date of a political resource curse, and provide evidence about the specific details of the underlying relationship: (i) natural resource wealth is anti-democratic, rather than merely stabilizing; (ii) it is driven primarily by changes in the composition of government revenue; (iii) it is best understood as a long-term relationship, rather than short-term changes in resource wealth being quickly translated into major political changes; and (iv) it is driven primarily by oil wealth, rather than mineral wealth, because governments are comparatively effective at translating oil wealth into the government revenues that drive the political resource curse.",22,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:295-312,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.014,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp295-312.html,2020-03-09 19:42:35," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
573,How environmental NGOs have influenced decision making in a ‘semi-authoritarian’ state: The case of forest policy in Ethiopia,"['Ayana, Alemayehu N.', 'Arts, Bas', 'Wiersum, K. Freerk']","Much has been written about the increasing contributions of non-governmental actors, such as environmental NGOs (ENGOs), to sustainable development, particularly in forest and environmental governance. However, little empirical evidence exists concerning the role and impact of these new actors in policy decisions where pluralist politics are lacking. By presenting the case of forest policy-making in Ethiopia, this paper illustrates the strategies of ENGOs, and how and to what extent they have impacted policy decisions, in a ‘semi-authoritarian’ context, where public policies are typically the exclusive mandate of governmental actors. We applied the policy arrangement approach (PAA), enriched with an ENGO classification, to analyze and explain the dynamics and nuances of policy processes. Our study finds that ENGOs do have an influence on policy-making under ‘semi-authoritarianism’, even without being formally invited to do so. However, influencing policy under such circumstances requires a circumspect approach and follows more complex pathways than the conventional policy-making steps in a democratic context. When the formal avenue for their participation in the policy-making process is restricted, these actors employ indirect strategies of catalyzing policy processes, such as demonstrating innovative policy approaches by implementing pilot projects, documenting and communicating field evidence and best practices, forming strong networks with like-minded actors, forging alliances with key decision makers, and investing sufficient human and financial resources to push the adoption of a new policy. The findings and the conclusions drawn in this paper are consistent with the conceptual framework employed.

First, acknowledging major structural changes that the Indian economy has undergone in the past three decades, we study whether public investment in recent years has become more or less complementary to private investment in comparison to the period before 1980. Second, we construct a novel data-set of quarterly aggregate public and private investment in India over the period 1996–2015 using investment-project data from the CapEx-CMIE database. Third, embedding a theory-driven long-run relationship on the model, we estimate a range of Structural Vector Error Correction Models (SVECMs) to re-examine the public and private investment relationship in India. Identification is achieved by decomposing shocks into those with transitory and permanent effects. Our results suggest that while public investment crowds out private investment in India over the period 1950–2012, the opposite is true when we restrict the sample to post 1980 or conduct a quarterly analysis since 1996.

For South Africa, where the labor market has less absorptive capacity, there is no employment benefit of electrification.

We distinguish close social networks (composed of friends and family) abroad and at the current location, and broad social networks (composed of same-country residents with intention to migrate, either internationally or locally). We find that social networks abroad are the most important driving forces of international migration intentions, with close and broad networks jointly explaining about 37% of variation in the probability intentions. Social networks are found to be more important factors driving migration intentions than work-related aspects or wealth (wealth accounts for less than 3% of the variation). In addition, we find that having stronger close social networks at home has the opposite effect by reducing the likelihood of migration intentions, both internationally and locally.",43,10,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:360-374,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.011,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp360-374.html,2020-03-09 19:42:54," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Early stages of new international conservation and development programs, often involving pilot projects designed to test intervention concepts at village level, are characterized by large amounts of resources and attention, along with high expectations of success. However, evidence shows that these early expectations are rarely fulfilled. Despite this repeated pattern and growing engagement with expectations in critical conservation and development literature, little is known about the dynamics of expectations in conservation and development pilot projects. We address this knowledge gap first by exploring concepts from the sociology of expectations. We then unpack expectations in a case study of REDD+ pilot projects in Tanzania, using extensive qualitative data reflecting the perspectives and experiences of a wide range of actors involved. Our study finds that expectations play a performative role, mobilizing actors and resources, despite uncertainty identified among policy-makers and practitioners. We also find that once raised, expectations are dynamic and continually mediated by actors and social contexts, which conflicts with attempts to ‘manage’ them. We argue therefore that a trade-off exists between fully piloting new initiatives and raising expectations. We also argue that failure to address this trade-off has implications beyond pilot project objectives and timelines, which are experienced most acutely by village communities. We argue for more critical engagement with expectations and the embedding of accountability for expectations in conservation and development practice. Our findings also challenge the discourse of ‘needing’ to pilot, which prioritizes awareness, impact and innovation without fully considering the potential negative impact of unfulfilled expectations.",2,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:375-385,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.006,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp375-385.html,2020-03-09 19:42:57," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

To date, much of the empirical research on water governance and urban transformations has examined developed cities, with limited investigation of developing cities. This paper therefore aims to enrich current empirical insights regarding the evolution of, and key shifts within urban water governance in Bangladesh. Drawing on recent developments in sustainability transitions and urban water governance scholarship, the paper charts 250 years of water resource development in Bangladesh. Analysis of primary and secondary qualitative data sources revealed five major periods between 1757 and 2016 that represent key changes to governance approaches that underpinned sectoral changes. Although the shifts in governance approaches have cumulatively improved the adaptive capacity of Bangladesh’s urban water system, they have not been framed to provide guidance and facilitation for driving on-ground change, which may be inhibiting a sustainable transformation of Bangladesh’s urban water sector. Nevertheless, the insights do provide important foundations for informing the development of new governance models capable of dealing with multi-scale strategies for supporting a sustainability transformation.",15,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:386-400,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.003,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp386-400.html,2020-03-09 19:43:01," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

We explore some demographic and economic characteristics of individuals who express support for acts of violent extremism (VE) by using an extensive cross-country multi-year survey dataset ranging from 2007 to 2014. A growing body of empirical research has focused on examining the various socio-economic underpinnings of violent extremism. The results have been inconclusive, at times contradictory and often based on limited set of case studies or smaller single time period cross-section datasets. In this study we use information on a little over forty-eight thousand individuals in 12 countries to evaluate the connections between socio-economic status and support for extremism. While the impact of the socio-economic characteristics on support for violence remains inconclusive in this analysis, we do find interesting and significant results when we interact individual economic status variables with the overall economic growth of the country. Unemployment status and having lower levels of education have significant impacts on the likelihood of support for VE when interacted with country level growth rate. We conclude that inequality or a feeling of being left out-being unemployed, in higher growth countries might be the key to understanding the economic underpinnings of violent extremism.",9,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:401-412,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.009,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp401-412.html,2020-03-09 19:43:05," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

We ask whether agricultural growth in developing countries increases the expenditures of poorer households more than growth in other sectors. While some reduced form analyses have tackled this question using either country-level time series data, regional panel data for one country, or cross-sectional country data, this paper is unusual in using panel data for many countries. We improve on much of the existing literature by devising an instrumental variables strategy to correct for the endogeneity of sectoral GDP growth, involving averaging over sectoral income growth rates for neighboring countries. Our principal finding from our instrumental variable estimator is that the estimated elasticities associated with growth in agricultural income are significantly greater than for non-agricultural income for all but the extreme top and bottom deciles. In the middle range of the income distribution the effect of a given GDP growth due to agriculture is 3–4 times larger than if it was due to non-agricultural activities. Having established that on average growth in GDP originating in agriculture is more beneficial for poorer deciles, we finally explore whether this is a pattern which holds across different groupings of countries. A second important finding is that there is heterogeneity across some groupings. Most particularly, we find that it is the poorest people in the poorest countries for whom agricultural income growth is the most beneficial.",26,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:417-428,10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.12.007,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp417-428.html,2020-03-09 19:43:09," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

We find that, in poor countries, increases in agricultural productivity generally have a larger poverty-reduction effect than increases in industry or services. This differential declines as average incomes rise, partly because agriculture becomes smaller as a share of the economy, and partly because agricultural productivity growth becomes less effective in reducing poverty. The source of the poverty-reduction benefits from agricultural productivity growth changes as innovations are more widely adopted—moving from increases in producer returns to reductions in consumer prices.",16,4,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:429-439,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.07.004,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp429-439.html,2020-03-09 19:43:12," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
583,Beyond Agriculture Versus Non-Agriculture: Decomposing Sectoral Growth–Poverty Linkages in Five African Countries,"['Dorosh, Paul', 'Thurlow, James']","Africa’s development debate is often cast as “agriculture versus non-agriculture”, with agriculture’s proponents arguing that agricultural growth is more effective at reducing poverty. This “dual economy” perspective overlooks the heterogeneity within and synergies between these two broad sectors. Recent studies decompose agriculture into subsectors and find that agricultural growth led by smallholder farmers is even more effective at reducing poverty than larger-scale estate farms. In contrast, few studies estimate subsectoral growth–poverty linkages for non-agriculture. Yet we strongly expect, for example, that growth led by informal traders or foreign-owned mining companies will have quite different implications for poverty reduction. Different perspectives on what constitutes “non-agriculture” might therefore explain divergent views on its relative importance for poverty reduction. To address this gap in our understanding, we estimate sectoral poverty–growth elasticities using economy-wide models for five African countries. While our estimated elasticities are higher for agriculture than for non-agriculture as a whole, the extent to which this is true varies considerably across nonagricultural subsectors (and across countries). We find that the poverty–growth elasticities for trade and transport services and manufacturing, especially agro-processing, are often close to, and sometimes exceed, agriculture’s. This means that growth led by these nonagricultural subsectors might be as effective as agriculture at reaching the poor. This confirms the need for a more nuanced treatment of non-agriculture in Africa’s policy debate, and may explain conflicting perspectives on agriculture’s role vis-à-vis non-agriculture.",25,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:440-451,10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.08.014,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp440-451.html,2020-03-09 19:43:16," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

We use the rural samples of the three waves of the Uganda National Panel Survey, and estimate panel regressions of child height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) controlling for time-invariant child-level heterogeneity. On the whole, we find no impact of short-term changes in total gross income on HAZ but document small positive correlations for younger children. Sector-differentiated analyses indicate that compared to wage earnings, only share of income from non-farm self-employment correlates positively with HAZ. Within agriculture, shares of income from consumption of own crop production and from low-protein crop production underlie the negative effect of share of income from crop production.

585,"Agricultural Productivity, Hired Labor, Wages, and Poverty: Evidence from Bangladesh","['Emran, Shahe', 'Shilpi, Forhad']","The rice yield and real agricultural wage in Bangladesh increased by 3.8% and 2.1% per annum respectively from 2000 to 2010. Over the same period, the share of hired labor in agriculture decreased from 19.4% to 15.5%. A focus of this paper is to understand if the observed changes in wages and hired labor are in part due to agricultural productivity growth as reflected in increasing rice yield. To estimate the effects of agricultural productivity, we take advantage of an Upazila (subdistrict)-level panel data set from Bangladesh and exploit variations in rainfall across Upazilas and over time. We find that a positive rainfall shock has a significant positive effect on crop yields, wages, per capita household expenditure and labor supplied to market activities (including own farming). The effect on hired labor is, in contrast, negative and statistically significant. In a standard neoclassical model, higher agricultural productivity affects wages and hired labor through labor demand; a rightward (leftward) shift increases (reduces) both wages and the amount of hired labor. The finding of a negative hired labor response to agricultural productivity growth with a higher wage thus appears puzzling. We develop a model where heterogeneity in labor supply response due to differences in productivity in home goods production can lead to a decline in hired labor when agricultural productivity increases, even though the equilibrium wage increases. Since the poor in rural areas depend disproportionately on wage labor, a decline in hired labor may be interpreted by some as evidence of adverse effects on poverty and inequality. The theoretical analysis, however, shows that the poor benefit from agricultural productivity growth even when the labor supply responses result in a decline in hired labor.",25,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:109:y:2018:i:c:p:470-482,10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.12.009,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v109y2018icp470-482.html,2020-03-09 19:43:23," 2018, Volume 109, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

We develop a three-location spatial applied general equilibrium model calibrated to the 2001 Tanzanian Social Accounting Matrix to examine the impact of various public investment programs on household welfare across this diverse geography in which production and consumption are locationally specific and transport costs support equilibrium price differences across locations. We examine how different public investment packages combined with reforms in the transport sector alter the equilibrium structure and location of economic activity. The choice of financing arrangement matters for welfare, since tax incidence, relative price, and real exchange rate movements are non-neutral. We show that the distributional consequences of alternative investment programs may matter more in terms of household welfare than the direct consequences of targeting investment to particular sectors or locations. For instance, under some financing scenarios, interventions that aid agriculture may lead to decreases in the welfare of the rural unskilled labor force, because the financing mechanisms create distortions that effectively skew the terms of trade sufficiently powerfully against the rural unskilled as to outweigh the direct welfare-enhancing effects of the public investment.

Our model underscores the importance of the following determinants of structural change: (i) productivity growth in the agricultural sector; (ii) productivity growth in the nonagricultural sector and; (iii) the terms of trade. Public investment enhances productivity growth in all sectors but when it is financed by foreign inflows, it also causes a real exchange rate appreciation leading to a contraction in the open modern sector. These results provide a partial explanation for recent patterns of growth in Rwanda and elsewhere in Africa where the nontradables or what we call the in-between sector has expanded more rapidly than the tradable sector.

By diverting production to local markets, these policies tend to reduce prices and increase domestic supply of food or intermediate inputs in the short term, to the benefit of consumers or manufacturers, which make them attractive to policymakers. However, in the long term, export restrictions discourage agricultural production, which may ultimately negate the short-term gains. This study assesses the economy-wide effects of Malawi’s long-term maize export ban, which was only recently lifted, and a proposed oilseed export levy intended to improve food security and support local processing industries, respectively. We find that maize export bans only benefit the urban non-poor, while poor farmers’ incomes and maize consumption levels decline in the longer run. The oilseed export levy also fails to achieve its long run objectives: even when tax revenues are used to further subsidize food processors, their gains in value-addition are outweighed by declining agricultural value-addition. More generally, these results show that while export restrictions may have the desired outcomes in the short run, production responses may render the policies ineffective in the medium to long run. Ultimately, such restrictive policies reinforce a subsistence approach to agriculture, which is inconsistent with the stated economic transformation goals of many Sub-Saharan African countries.",16,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:1-15,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.03.020,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp1-15.html,2020-03-09 19:43:38," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

But closing the “gap” between policy makers and people is not straightforward, since distancing effects are produced by a combination of geography, politics and knowledge. This article analyses the case of an experimental initiative in Bangladesh known as the “reality check” that attempted to influence policy makers in the health and education sectors by providing them with people-centered data gathered at community level. The case is analyzed as an example of “methodological populism” that combined participatory and ethnographic approaches, and as one that challenged current managerialist cultures of what can be considered as acceptable evidence for policy. The case highlights tensions between participation, populism and policy that are potentially productive but constrained by three sets of factors: (i) contestations over the status of “popular knowledge”, (ii) the need for critical “policy spaces” within policy processes in which policy makers can engage with such knowledge, and (iii) the “disruptive temporalities” within policy processes that tend to inhibit learning. Drawing on the “guarded hopefulness” of meta-modernist theory, the paper concludes that if more attention can be paid to such issues, initiatives informed by methodological populism such as the reality check could be further built upon in ways that may contribute to the humanization or “peopling” of policy processes.",7,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:16-27,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.03.012,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp16-27.html,2020-03-09 19:43:42," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

National anti-corruption discourses, lived experiences of petty corruption, and the failures of development projects to bring meaningful benefits encourage various stakeholders to manoeuvre to get a share, or take their part from the resources that flow from the state. The impact of this logic exceed its practices, however.

593,Can group farms outperform individual family farms? Empirical insights from India,"['Agarwal, Bina']","Is there an alternative model to small family farming that could provide sustainable livelihoods to millions of resource-constrained and often non-viable smallholders in developing countries? Could group farming constitute such an alternative, wherein smallholders voluntarily pool land, labour and capital to create larger farms that they manage collectively? In South Asia, for instance, over 85% of farmers are small and increasingly female. Potentially, group farming could provide them economies of scale, a dependable labour force, more investible funds and skills, and greater bargaining power with governments and markets. But can this potential be realised in practice? In particular, can group farms economically outperform small family farms? A rare opportunity to test this is provided by two experiments begun in the 2000s in the Indian states of Kerala and Telangana. Constituted only of women, the groups lease in land to farm collectively, sharing labour, the cost of inputs, and the returns. But the states differ in several respects, including the technical support the groups receive, and their institutional base, composition, land access and cropping patterns. Based on the author's primary sample surveys in both states, this paper compares the productivity and profitability of group farms with that of small individual family farms in the same state. Kerala’s groups perform strikingly better than the predominantly male-managed individual farms, both in their annual value of output per hectare and annual net returns per farm, while in Telangana group farms perform much worse than individual farms in annual output, but are equivalent in net returns. In both states, groups do much better in commercial crops than in traditional foodgrains, where the largely male-managed individual farms, owning good quality land and with longer farm management experience, have an advantage. The factors underlying the differential performances of Kerala and Telangana, and the lessons learnt for possible replication, are also discussed. Overall, the paper demonstrates that group farming can provide an effective alternative, subject to specified conditions and adaptation of the model to the local context.",18,5,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:57-73,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.03.010,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp57-73.html,2020-03-09 19:43:53," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

We find that the state entity responsible for carrying out the events applied three main depoliticizing practices: (a) the organization of exclusionary participatory processes, (b) the provision of pro-extraction information, and (c) the identification of critical actors and discourses in order to formulate recommendations on how to weaken resistance against the planned activities. This study also reveals that local populations often contested the participatory events and identifies subnational patterns of local contestation. We find that higher degrees of contestation were fueled by previous negative experiences with extraction activities and the existence of local economic alternatives. To assess the histories and results of contestation over specific extractive activities over time, the study draws on monthly conflict reports produced by the Peruvian ombudsperson (2007–2016). We find that local contestation was quite influential, leading to increased social investment programs in the affected areas, the withdrawal of several extraction corporations, and Peru’s adoption of the Law on Prior Consultation (2011). However, the long-term prospects of the transformations provoked by repoliticizing processes need to be evaluated in the years to come.",13,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:74-85,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.03.019,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp74-85.html,2020-03-09 19:43:57," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
595,Gender lessons for climate initiatives: A comparative study of REDD+ impacts on subjective wellbeing,"['Larson, Anne M.', 'Solis, David', 'Duchelle, Amy E.', 'Atmadja, Stibniati', 'Resosudarmo, Ida Aju Pradnja', 'Dokken, Therese', 'Komalasari, Mella']","Although REDD+ is primarily a mechanism for reducing carbon emissions from forests, concerns regarding social benefits, wellbeing and gender are increasingly part of its mandate. This is consistent with the Paris Declaration as well as SDG 5 on gender equality and women’s empowerment. Critics have argued, however, that REDD+ design, both in policy and projects, does not take gender into account effectively, rather marginalizing women from decision making processes and exacerbating inequalities. Most of that research has been site specific or on single countries. This article uses data from a longitudinal study of subnational REDD+ initiatives in six countries to analyze their gendered impact on perceived wellbeing. Comparative research on subjective wellbeing was conducted at 62 villages participating in 16 REDD+ initiatives and 61 control villages at two periods in time, using a before-after-control-intervention (BACI) design. Focus groups with villagers (68% male) and women (100% female) permit a gendered comparison of definitions of wellbeing and outcomes of initiatives. The results highlight that while definitions of wellbeing overlapped between the two groups, almost half of the women’s focus groups thought that having their own source of income was important. Outcomes regarding wellbeing change suggest that perceived wellbeing decreased in REDD+ villages both for villagers as a whole and for women, relative to control villages, but the decrease was much worse for women – a decrease that is significantly associated with living in a REDD+ village. These declines may be due to unrealized expectations for REDD+, combined with little attention to gender in REDD+ initiatives, in spite of an important portion (46%) of specific interventions that women view positively. These interventions provide insights into potential ways forward. Overall, however, REDD+ initiatives appear to be repeating past mistakes, with insufficient attention to gender equality and safeguarding women’s rights. More effort needs to be paid to ensuring that gender is an integral part of future initiatives to combat climate change in rural communities.",1 Reference,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:86-102,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.027,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp86-102.html,2020-03-09 19:44:00," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Along Ghana's Offin River, recent mining activities have irreversibly transformed the landscape and lives of local people. Cocoa farms, subsistence crops, forest, and other land-uses have been cleared, with significant implications for livelihoods and food security. Rivers and streams were rerouted into mining sites to wash sediment, impacting hydrology, including water quality. Abandoned pits now stretch for kilometers and pose everyday hazards to community members. While minerals law reserves “small-scale” mining as a right for Ghanaian citizens, both foreigners and Ghanaians control and mine concessions, reflecting complicated land-grabbing processes in the sector. Combining geospatial, ethnographic and quantitative methodological approaches with long-term international collaboration, this article examines the spatial and socio-environmental dimensions of “small-scale” gold mining. We employed remote sensing techniques, underutilized in land-grabbing research, to assess mining-mediated land-use changes along a portion of the Offin River. The total extent of mining increased 2,772.6 percent to 998.23 hectares between 2008 and 2013; “mine water” increased by 13,000 percent to cover 200 hectares. We argue these extensive land-use conversions are enabled through Ghana's contradictory and gendered land tenure systems. While scholars often characterize land deals as occurring through theft and dispossession, we found miners' access land through ad hoc negotiations before mining, compensation following crop destruction and outright dispossession. We detail the diverse actors and practices mediating informal land markets, and the uneven implications for people positioned within social and structural hierarchies, particularly women and “strangers.” Our research troubles “small-scale” categorizations and discursive representations of mining, and urges land-grabbing researchers to examine prolific smaller deals alongside transactions involving thousands of hectares.",18,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:103-114,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.03.014,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp103-114.html,2020-03-09 19:44:04," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Pastoralism faces increased vulnerability to climate change, and pastoralist women are both disproportionately affected by severe drought and underrepresented in formal decision-making processes. Increased participation by women in decision-making thus promises to offer a win–win solution: greater gender equality as well as enhanced resilience to persistent drought. This quasi-experimental study evaluates an intervention that aimed to increase drought preparedness in northern Kenyan pastoralist communities through the empowerment of women at the household and community levels. It uses a difference-in-differences design combined with matching estimation to causally isolate effects of the intervention. At the community level, there was an increase in women's political awareness and participation in formal decision-making processes, but that participation did not translate into meaningful outcomes. At the household level, however, there was a large and positive effect on actions taken to better prepare for drought (which mostly took the form of pre-emptive livestock sales).

While the impacts of these interventions on poverty reduction and market participation by smallholders has been studied, little is known about their contributions to building climate resilience. This paper analyzes the compatibility of market systems and climate resilience approaches to agricultural development, using the United States government’s Feed the Future program as an empirical case study. Drawing on case studies in Ethiopia and Honduras, the paper examines the synergies and tensions between market systems and climate resilience approaches. The study finds that the market systems interventions have contributed to climate resilience, but also evidence of significant limitations due to fundamental tensions between market system and resilience approaches in terms of what their goals are, who they target, and how they approach their objectives. This study has important implications for the design and implementation of climate resilience programs and policies, as well as the expectations that agricultural development programs will be able to build climate resilience.

Our evaluation uses a stratified random assignment design, whereby districts were matched on baseline characteristics and randomly assigned to either a treatment or a control group. Using nationally representative household-level survey data, we find a pattern of small negative effects on citizens’ perceived access to government information, perceived personal influence on government officials, and satisfaction with government services.

We use a questionnaire survey to collect data from 325 SMEs in the semi-arid regions of Kenya and Senegal and analyze this information to estimate the quality of current adaptation measures, distinguishing between sustainable and unsustainable adaptation. We then study the link between these current adaptation practices and adaptation planning for future climate change. We find that financial barriers are a key reason why firms resort to unsustainable adaptation, while general business support, access to information technology and adaptation assistance encourages sustainable adaptation responses. Engaging in adaptation today also increases the likelihood that a firm is preparing for future climate change. The finding lends support to the strategy of many development agencies who use adaptation to current climate variability as a way of building resilience to future climate change. There is a clear role for public policy in facilitating good adaptation. The ability of firms to respond to climate risks depends in no small measure on factors such as business environment that can be shaped through policy intervention.",23,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:157-168,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.03.015,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp157-168.html,2020-03-09 19:44:19," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
601,How African cities lead: Urban policy innovation and agriculture in Kampala and Nairobi,"['Gore, Christopher D.']","City governments in sub-Saharan Africa have historically been beholden to national governments. Lack of national urban policies and tensions between national and city governments are common. Yet, for decades, research has identified small-scale innovations at the urban scale. Rarely, however, are policy innovations in African cities so influential as to lead national governments to scale up city based actions. This is particularly true in sectors that have been the dominant purview of central governments. This paper examines how citizens, civil society organizations, city governments and national bureaucrats in two cities of East Africa – Kampala and Nairobi – have interacted to produce policy innovation in agriculture. Agriculture has always been a sector of high national importance in Africa, but increasingly cities are becoming focal points for agricultural policy change. The two cities compared in the paper are unusual in having a collection of interests who have been advocating for improved support and recognition of urban food production. Indeed, these cities are rare for having continually promoted the formalization of urban agriculture in local and national policy. While advocacy for urban agriculture is common globally, what is not clear is under what conditions local advocacy produces policy uptake and change. What are the conditions when city-based advocacy deepens the institutionalization of policy support locally and nationally? Drawing from theory and research on policy change and African urban politics and governance, and qualitative data collection in each country, this paper argues that while external, international assistance has helped initiate policy dialogue, domestic civil society organizations and their engagement with local and national bureaucrats are key to policy support at the local and national scales.",12,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:169-180,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.03.011,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp169-180.html,2020-03-09 19:44:23," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
602,A human rights-consistent approach to multidimensional welfare measurement applied to sub-Saharan Africa,"['Arndt, Channing', 'Mahrt, Kristi', 'Hussain, M. Azhar', 'Tarp, Finn']","The rights-based approach to development targets progress towards the realization of 30 articles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In current practice, progress is frequently measured using the multidimensional poverty index. While elegant and useful, the multidimensional poverty index is inconsistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights principles of indivisibility, inalienability, and equality. We argue that a first-order dominance (FOD) methodology maintains basic consistency with these principles. Specifically, FOD comparisons are independent of any applied weighting schemes and hence are free from assumptions regarding substitutability between included welfare indicators (indivisibility). FOD cannot be established when welfare in any indicator is deteriorating, no matter how great the advancement is in other indicators (inalienability). Finally, FOD requires that domination occurs throughout the population (equality), implying that welfare gains among better-off groups never offset welfare losses among worse-off groups. We discuss and compare the properties of the multidimensional poverty index and first-order dominance approach and apply both measures to 26 African countries using data near 2002 and 2012. Results across the two measures are broadly similar but not the same. For example, while the multidimensional poverty index suggests that all countries are advancing, FOD indicates that 14 countries experience broad-based progress, two countries show more moderate likelihoods of progress, and the remaining 10 countries neither improve nor deteriorate in terms of attainment of rights for the dimensions considered. We conclude that the multidimensional poverty index and first-order dominance approaches are useful complements that should be employed in tandem.",35,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:181-196,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.03.022,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp181-196.html,2020-03-09 19:44:27," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

It documents that countries joining GATT/WTO after 1990 have implemented tariff-cum-tax reforms, lowering tariff rates and raising consumption tax rates, in particular through reform or introduction of a value added tax (VAT). Employing a panel of 97 developing and transitional countries, 31 of which joined GATT/WTO between 1990 and 2011, using robust difference-in-difference specifications as well as the synthetic control method, we find a statistically and economically significant decline in revenues from import duties. This finding supports concerns about revenue losses, but also corroborates the efficacy of the late Uruguay GATT and the WTO trade regimes in promoting free trade among new members. Regarding consumption taxes, we find robust evidence that revenue substitution was successful, since revenue losses from import duties were more than compensated for by enhanced revenues from consumption taxes. With regard to the timing of the revenue effects, our results show that revenue losses in import duties mostly take place at the time of membership or later. Changes in consumption taxation, however, exhibit pre-membership effects, as revenues are increased, and VAT is adopted, often a few years ahead of losses in import duties. No such effects are found before the start of the accession negotiations, indicating that consumption tax reforms are initiated once a country is on the road to GATT/WTO membership.",44,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:197-218,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.020,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp197-218.html,2020-03-09 19:44:30," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

605,Pathways of adaptation to external stressors in coastal natural-resource-dependent communities: Implications for climate change,"['Fischer, Alexandra Paige']","Adaptation to climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing coastal communities today. Coastal communities are subject to a wide range of stressors related to climate change, including biological resource decline and natural hazards. Small historically natural-resource-dependent communities are particularly vulnerable because of their close reliance on ecosystem goods and services that are likely to be affected by climate change (e.g., fisheries, forests) and their limited access to outside technical and financial resources needed for adaptation. Exogenous adaptation policies, while helpful for fostering new behavioral adjustments to address resource decline and natural hazards, can in some cases exacerbate socioeconomic disruption, further burdening communities already struggling to adapt. This paper presents an investigation of how six historically natural-resource-dependent coastal communities in Oregon, USA, have experienced and responded to external stressors and how adaptation in these communities has been shaped by interactions between past and present practices, processes, and vulnerabilities. Despite climate-related impacts identified by the scientific community, climate change was not salient in the community members’ reports of stressors and impacts, and thus was not a trigger of adaptation. Rather, communities were responding to stressors associated with decades of declines in natural resource industries, an economic recession, restrictive natural resource management and land use policies, demographic change, and natural hazards. These findings confirm other research findings that chronic everyday problems, including those related to the maintenance of livelihoods, or consequences of inadequate livelihoods, often eclipse potentially disastrous threats in the minds of rural community members, thereby influencing adaptation strategies. In some cases communities do not prioritize such threats because people have come to accept living with them, or they feel powerless and unable to change the circumstances of daily life. The findings improve understanding of adaptation in natural-resource-based coastal communities in the USA and support the need for policy makers and planners to integrate climate change adaptation into livelihood improvement strategies.",16,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:235-248,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.12.007,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp235-248.html,2020-03-09 19:44:37," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
606,Multi-Scalar Pathways to Smallholder Adaptation,"['Burnham, Morey', 'Ma, Zhao']","Smallholder farmers in the Loess Plateau Region of China are highly vulnerable to climate change. Effective adaptation governance requires in-depth, situated understanding of how adaptation is embedded in particular environmental, social, political, economic, and institutional contexts. Drawing on 93 qualitative interviews with smallholder households in five counties across three provinces on the Loess Plateau, we use a multi-scalar pathways approach to analyze two particular adaptations (planting maize and adopting drip irrigation). Our results show (1) how historical and ongoing multi-scalar, social–ecological processes interact to shape smallholder adaptation decision-making, leading to synergies, tensions, and contradictions across risk management domains and social institutions; (2) whether an adaptation strategy persists over time is in part determined by the extent to which the strategy allows smallholder households to manage various forms of risk and uncertainty in both the present and future; and (3) how past and ongoing multi-scalar adaptation pathways determine not only smallholder exposure to current stressors but also possible choices for future adaptation. Specifically, we find some smallholder adaptive strategies, such as planting maize, stabilize over time because they enable smallholders to manage market risk, climatic risk, and water pollution challenges, allow them to take advantage of opportunities to diversify their livelihoods through local wage work and labor migration, and, at the same time, fit the local social institutions that guide their agricultural management decisions. We also find some adaptive strategies promoted by non-local actors, such as drip irrigation, are abandoned because they create tensions with the ways smallholders construct their livelihoods to manage various forms of uncertainty and risk, and contradict the local social relations and cultural values embedded in their day-to-day lives. Together, these results provide insight into why particular smallholder adaptation pathways become stabilized and reproduced over time, and the cross-scalar environmental, social, political, economic, and institutional processes that underpin them.",15,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:249-262,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.08.005,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp249-262.html,2020-03-09 19:44:41," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
607,"Toward a Political Ecology of Migration: Land, Labor Migration, and Climate Change in Northwestern Nicaragua","['Radel, Claudia', 'Schmook, Birgit', 'Carte, Lindsey', 'Mardero, Sofia']","Smallholder labor migration and its relationship to climate change adaptation has received increasing attention, with migration often represented either as part of successful adaptive livelihood diversification or as symptomatic of a lack of in-place adaptive capacity. Using a case study, we focus on the relationship between labor migration, agrarian livelihood diversification, and climate change to further a more nuanced understanding of “migration as adaptation” than is implied by a simple dichotomy of success versus failure. Smallholder diversification, both on- and off-farm, has largely been framed as a risk-spreading practice that lowers climate change vulnerability. But after decades of advocating livelihood diversification, with labor migration now increasingly a part of smallholder livelihood activities, it is urgent to pose a number of questions: Why do smallholders migrate? How does labor migration unfold for them and with what outcomes? Our primary goal here is to explore the nature of the relationship of labor migration to climate change and climate change adaptation. Through empirical fieldwork in northwestern Nicaragua, we explore the role of labor migration in smallholder household production and reproduction, as families confront increasingly difficult climatic conditions for agricultural production and a relative absence of the state within a neoliberal political economy. Our analysis draws on household surveys and qualitative interviews and focus groups we carried out in the municipality of Somotillo, in northwestern Nicaragua, over three years (2013–15). Our findings demonstrate that household labor migration neither facilitates adaptation to climate change nor reflects a failure to adapt, but rather reflects the weak position of smallholders in interlocking relations of power and the relative land scarcity experienced by many. We argue that labor migration barely maintains semi-subsistence agricultural production and reinforces existing social inequalities, raising questions regarding a conceptualization of “migration as adaptation” and the benefits of this type of livelihood diversification.",9,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:263-273,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.04.023,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp263-273.html,2020-03-09 19:44:47," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
608,Re-Defining Sahelian ‘Adaptive Agriculture’ when Implemented Locally: Beyond Techno-fix Solutions,"['Rasmussen, Laura Vang']","Climate-related adaptation practices are often conscious policy decisions initiated from outside a community by governments, development agencies, or other actors. Whereas expectations that such adaptation strategies would positively interact with local priorities to support action, adaptive actions at one scale might also constrain actions at other scales depending on the context. Yet, limited empirical evidence exists on the tensions, or, in the best case, synergies between adaptation practices that cross spatial scales, policy arenas, and jurisdictional boundaries. Drawing on a longitudinal study conducted in agropastoral communities in Burkina Faso, I examined how higher scale agricultural adaptation actions initiated by government and international organizations were re-defined when implemented locally. The findings illuminate a discrepancy between the aims of (a) higher scale adaptation practices and (b) the strategies pursued by local agropastoralists. While higher scale initiatives, promoted since the great droughts hit the region in the 1970s and 1980s, remained technical in nature and aimed to boost agricultural food production, local strategies were primarily pursued to secure off-farm income and animal fodder. Efforts to advance adaptation across scales will necessitate better attention to local contexts such as off-farm activities as integrated and viable ways of agropastoralists’ ‘agricultural’ adaptation repertoire, and institutions, organizations, and local networks should move forward with collaborative processes, including local stakeholders from the outset, to develop broader adaptation plans than technological-only.",11,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:274-282,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.03.034,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp274-282.html,2020-03-09 19:44:51," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

610,Assessing multi-level drivers of adaptation to climate variability and water insecurity in smallholder irrigation systems,"['McCord, Paul', 'Waldman, Kurt', 'Baldwin, Elizabeth', ""Dell'Angelo, Jampel"", 'Evans, Tom']","Smallholder agriculturalists employ a range of strategies to adapt to climate variability. These adaptive strategies include decisions to plant different seed varieties, changes to the array of cultivated crops, and shifts in planting dates. Smallholder access to irrigation water is crucial to the adoption of such strategies, and uncertainty of water availability may prove to be a stimulating force in a smallholder’s decision to adjust their on-farm practices. Within smallholder irrigation systems, attributes at multiple levels influence water availability and collective action, and in the process play a role in adaptation: community-level governance institutions may influence trust in others and the ability to overcome appropriation and provisioning dilemmas, and, at the household-level, the availability of irrigation water and socioeconomic and demographic factors may influence farmer willingness to take on the risk of altering their on-farm practices. In this study we investigate smallholder adaptation in Kenya from multiple levels. Specifically, we identify the role of household- and community-level characteristics in shaping smallholder experimentation with different seed varieties. Standard ordinary least squares and logistic regressions are constructed to assess the influence of these interactions on smallholder adaptation. We further discuss the ability of smallholders to respond to poor water provisioning. Among the study’s findings is evidence that smallholders are more willing to employ adaptive measures if they have a limited capacity to irrigate.",22,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:296-308,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.009,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp296-308.html,2020-03-09 19:44:58," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
611,Linking climate change strategies and land conflicts in Cambodia: Evidence from the Greater Aural region,"['Hunsberger, Carol', 'Work, Courtney', 'Herre, Roman']","This paper investigates how climate change strategies and resource conflicts are shaping each other in the Greater Aural region of western Cambodia. Agro-industrial projects linked to climate change goals are reshaping both social and ecological dynamics, by altering patterns of access to land and water resources as well as the nature of the resources themselves. Using a landscape perspective, we investigate these social and ecological changes occurring across space and time. Drawing on data from community researchers, field visits, interviews and secondary sources, we examine two kinds of connections between climate change responses and resource conflicts in the Greater Aural: 1) demand for biofuels as a driver of flex crop expansion; and 2) the construction of irrigation infrastructure as a climate change adaptation strategy. Findings include that some impacts of flex crop expansion and irrigation systems are local and immediate, for example when villagers lose land, plantation workers are not paid, and cassava processing pollutes local water supplies. Other impacts are transferred to different locations or deferred to the future, for example when changes in water quality and quantity affect those living downstream, or when soil degraded by cassava production becomes unproductive for future generations. We conclude that climate change strategies are now deeply entangled with resource conflicts in the Greater Aural region. Adopting a landscape perspective and working directly with community researchers opens new pathways for identifying not only site-specific, but also cumulative and shifting impacts of climate change strategies and their relationship to resource conflicts.",10,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:309-320,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.008,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp309-320.html,2020-03-09 19:45:01," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
612,Household Livelihood Differentiation and Vulnerability to Climate Hazards in Rural China,"['Tian, Qing', 'Lemos, Maria Carmen']","Rural households in the developing world increasingly participate in urban and broader economies. While nonfarm income may reduce their dependence on climate-reliant agricultural activities, how the diversification of income and livelihoods affects rural households’ vulnerability is complex because of many interacting stressors at play. This study uses household survey data collected in the Poyang Lake area of China—a region historically vulnerable to flooding—to analyze rural vulnerability against the background of state-led development. We look at the three components of climate vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, and focus on examining households’ allocations of assets and labor to illustrate the complex processes that affect rural livelihoods and households’ adaptive capacity. We find that overall sensitivity to flooding has been reduced, particularly for those households with relatively high exposure. These changes suggest increased adaptive capacity and reduced flood vulnerability relative to the commune period and are the result of two main processes. First, the livelihoods of rural households have become increasingly differentiated amid broad industrial and urban development; and second, the presence of regional flood risk management has reduced exposure for agriculture-oriented households.",18,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:321-331,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.10.019,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp321-331.html,2020-03-09 19:45:05," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
613,Local values and fairness in climate change adaptation: Insights from marginal rural Australian communities,"['Graham, Sonia', 'Barnett, Jon', 'Mortreux, Colette', 'Hurlimann, Anna', 'Fincher, Ruth']","A key criterion of successful adaptation to climate change is that it avoids potential inequalities arising from climate impacts or from adaptation strategies themselves. Recent research on adaptation in developing and developed countries argues that the measures of such fairness cannot be captured by standard metrics of vulnerability and should be situated in the milieu of people’s daily lives and temporalities. Yet there is little empirical evidence to support this theoretical argument. This paper describes a method, and presents findings from research that aimed to understand and classify the lived values of four marginal rural communities at risk of sea-level rise in Australia to inform adaptation planning and implementation. Our research finds that there are at least five types of primary residents and second home-owners attached to these four low-lying coastal communities. Some of these residents are more likely to be amenable to relocation if their needs for affordable living and belonging are met. For others, there may be little that can be done to compensate for the loss of place attachment, and implementing a measured approach that provides them time to adapt to the idea of change and form connections to new places is the best that could be achieved. We discuss the implications of place-specific and people-centric values for achieving fair adaptation.",10,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:108:y:2018:i:c:p:332-343,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.12.008,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v108y2018icp332-343.html,2020-03-09 19:45:09," 2018, Volume 108, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
614,Wealth-destroying private property rights,"['Leeson, Peter T.', 'Harris, Colin']","According to conventional wisdom, privatizing the commons will create wealth. Yet in cases found throughout the developing world, privatizing the commons has destroyed wealth. To explain this phenomenon, we develop a theory of wealth-destroying private property rights. Privatization’s effect on social wealth depends on whether privatizing an asset confers net gains or imposes net losses on society. The decision to privatize, however, depends on whether privatizing an asset confers net gains or imposes net losses on property decision makers. When decision makers are residual claimants, these effects move in tandem; privatization occurs only if it creates social wealth. When decision makers are not residual claimants, these effects may diverge; privatization occurs if it benefits decision makers personally even if privatization destroys social wealth.

In response, some governments have shifted towards community-based, common property resource management policies. While there is emerging evidence that these policies can reduce deforestation, there has been less research assessing the effect of these concessions on rural livelihoods. This is surprising, since sustainable income generation is an important outcome that can influence the long-term success of concession policies. This study examines the effect of community-managed forest concessions on income in the context of the Maya Biosphere Reserve in northern Guatemala. In this region, forest concessions have been established in the past 20 years to give local residents access to the forests. Residents granted access to a forest concession are required to reduce overexploitation by abiding by a sustainable forest management plan and obtaining certification from the Forest Stewardship Council. In the Maya Biosphere Reserve, the characteristics of concession communities vary and the sustainable management plan is often tailored to meet the needs of the community. The results show that the effects of participating in a forest concession on income are generally positive, although there is significant heterogeneity among communities with different socioeconomic characteristics.",16,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:107:y:2018:i:c:p:10-21,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.011,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v107y2018icp10-21.html,2020-03-09 19:45:16," 2018, Volume 107, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Specifically, we examine the effects of sanitation coverage and usage on child height for age in a semi-urban setting in Northern India. Although sanitation – broadly defined as hygienic means of promoting health through prevention of human contact with the hazards of wastes, particularly human waste – has long been acknowledged as an indispensable element of disease prevention and primary health care programmes, a large number of recent impact evaluation studies on sanitation interventions in low income countries fail to find any health improvements. We address endogeneity of sanitation coverage through an instrumental variable approach, exploiting variation in raw material construction prices. Doing so, we find that sanitation coverage plays a significant and positive role in height growth during the first years of life and that this causal relationship holds particularly for girls. Our findings suggest that a policy that aims to increase sanitation coverage in a context such as the one studied here, is not only effective in reducing child stunting but also implicitly targets girls.",29,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:107:y:2018:i:c:p:22-39,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.005,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v107y2018icp22-39.html,2020-03-09 19:45:20," 2018, Volume 107, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

We present an innovative use of collective action games to not only measure propensity for cooperation, but to improve local understanding of groundwater interrelationships and stimulate collective governance of groundwater, based on a pilot study in Andhra Pradesh, India. The games simulate crop choice and consequences for the aquifer. These were followed by a community debriefing, which provided an entry point for discussing the interconnectedness of groundwater use, to affect mental models about groundwater. A slightly modified game was played in the same communities, one year later. Our study finds communication within the game increased the likelihood of groups reaching sustainable extraction levels in the second year of play, but not the first. Individual payments to participants based on how they played in the game had no effect on crop choice. Either repeated experience with the games or the revised structure of the game evoked more cooperation in the second year, outweighing other factors influencing behavior, such as education, gender, and trust index scores. After the games were played, a significantly higher proportion of communities adopted water registers and rules to govern groundwater, compared to other communities in the same NGO water commons program. Because groundwater levels are affected by many factors, games alone will not end groundwater depletion. However, games can contribute to social learning about the role of crop choice and collective action, to motivate behavior change toward more sustainable groundwater extraction.",28,4,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:107:y:2018:i:c:p:40-53,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.006,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v107y2018icp40-53.html,2020-03-09 19:45:23," 2018, Volume 107, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

To our knowledge, this is the first econometric study of the activities of agents in a country as underdeveloped as the DRC. More important than agents’ personal characteristics, transactions are higher in low income, densely populated areas with high levels of commercial development, suggesting that the agent network has been best at supporting financial transactions among the urban poor. In addition, branding and effective liquidity management are strongly linked to agent activity. The results suggest that agents can be effective providers of basic financial services among the urban poor who lack suitable alternatives.

Drawing empirical data from two drought-prone districts in Northeastern Ethiopia (Kobo and Raya Azebo), this article deals with the differentiated effects of planned adaptation, exemplified by Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP). Two layers of differentiating effects are studied by looking at the differences between households that are and households that are not targeted by PSNP; and the more detailed differences are explored by zooming in on male and female-headed households, respectively, within the subset of households targeted by PSNP. We use semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with female and male household heads and key informant interviews with government officials. Our study indicates that the interplay has a differentiated effect following the participation of households in planned adaptation programs and gender lines. We show that the effect on building community assets can be positive at the community level and expands autonomous adaptation particularly for non-targeted households; however, targeted households in general and female-headed households in particular experience a negative effect of the interplay: planned adaptation constrains autonomous adaptation due to time and labor demands of public work, program restrictions and local gender norms.",10,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:107:y:2018:i:c:p:87-97,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.03.001,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v107y2018icp87-97.html,2020-03-09 19:45:34," 2018, Volume 107, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Our multi-method approach has been conceptually informed by Agrawal and Perrin’s (2008) climate adaptation framework and included semi-structured interviews at the household level, and participatory hazard mapping with diverse focus groups at the community level. Our study finds that due to diverse value-based assessments of livelihood opportunities and climate-related risks, communal and household adaptive strategies can differ widely, even in a very localized cultural context.

However, if a targeted intervention changes a household’s utility maximization problem or influences decision-making, households might respond to the intervention in unintended ways with the potential to affect the wellbeing of non-targeted members. Using panel data from a randomized controlled nutrition trial in Ghana, we evaluate household behavioral responses to the provision of small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) to mothers and their infants to prevent undernutrition. We find that targeted supplementation with SQ-LNS had a positive effect on household expenditures on food, including some nutrient-rich food groups, as well as on non-food goods and services. We also find a positive impact on labor income, particularly among fathers. We then explore intrahousehold spillover effects on the nutritional status of non-targeted young children in the household. We find evidence that the targeted provision of SQ-LNS led to higher height-for-age z-scores among non-targeted children in the LNS group compared to the non-LNS group, though only among those with relatively taller mothers, which is an indicator of a child’s growth potential. These findings support existing evidence and suggest that unintended behavioral responses and spillover are a real possibility in the context of nutrition interventions targeting nutritionally-vulnerable household members.

An important question today is how to increase the reach and profitability of microfinance, in a context where subsidies are withdrawing to promote the viability and sustainability of microfinance institutions (MFIs). Efficiency analysis has found favor in this context and has attracted growing interest among professionals, partners, and researchers. Abundant empirical work has been conducted over the last ten years on this subject, in very different contexts and with different methodologies. The purpose of this article is to provide a meta-regression analysis on parametric and nonparametric estimations of Mean Technical Efficiency (MTE) in microfinance, using a data set of 262 observations from 38 studies. The results show that, in the microfinance industry, MTE scores have increased over time. However, with an MTE rate of approximately 61.1%, there is room for improving efficiency. MFIs use more resources than necessary for the results achieved in terms of outreach and revenue generated. Our results show heterogeneity of MTE according to the methodological approach of the studies. Studies with a larger number of variables (inputs and outputs) produced higher MTE scores than did those with a smaller number of variables. Studies using the variable returns to scale assumption resulted in higher MTE scores than those using constant returns to scale. In addition, those with a production approach had higher MTEs than did those using the intermediation approach, while studies of a large number of MFIs had lower scores than did those involving a small sample size. Moreover, research estimating social efficiency generated lower MTEs compared to those estimating financial efficiency. Studies using data from African MFIs obtained lower MTEs than did those on MFIs in Latin America and MENA, which confirms the poor performance of African microfinance.",84,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:107:y:2018:i:c:p:176-188,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.032,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v107y2018icp176-188.html,2020-03-09 19:46:00," 2018, Volume 107, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Monitoring progress towards this goal however is challenging due to the limited availability of gender-disaggregated data, particularly in low-income countries. In this data sparse context, we examine the potential of a source of digital trace ‘big data’ – Facebook’s advertisement audience estimates – that provides aggregate data on Facebook users by demographic characteristics covering the platform’s over 2 billion users to measure and ‘nowcast’ digital gender gaps. We generate a unique country-level dataset combining ‘online’ indicators of Facebook users by gender, age and device type, ‘offline’ indicators related to a country’s overall development and gender gaps, and official data on gender gaps in internet and mobile access where available. Using this dataset, we predict internet and mobile phone gender gaps from official data using online indicators, as well as online and offline indicators. We find that the online Facebook gender gap indicators are highly correlated with official statistics on internet and mobile phone gender gaps. For internet gender gaps, models using Facebook data do better than those using offline indicators alone. Models combining online and offline variables however have the highest predictive power. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of using Facebook data for real-time tracking of digital gender gaps.

629,New reading of Saharan agricultural transformation: Continuities of ancient oases and their extensions (Algeria),"['Hamamouche, Meriem Farah', 'Kuper, Marcel', 'Amichi, Hichem', 'Lejars, Caroline', 'Ghodbani, Tarik']","Agriculture in the Algerian Sahara underwent radical transformations during the second half of the 20th century. Agricultural development programs, aiming to integrate the Sahara in the national economy, were based on an agribusiness model implemented outside existing oases – in the so-called extensions – through the conquest of new agricultural land and the use of pumped groundwater. The rehabilitation of existing ‘traditional’ oases received less attention as their capacity for agricultural development was thought limited. While the new agricultural landscape is considered by policy makers to be a creatio ex nihilo, we demonstrate that the extensions are in fact, the creatio ex materia of the ancient oases, and that the two Saharan agricultural landscapes are firmly connected. The objective of this article is then to challenge the dichotomous view of Saharan agricultural development and the underlying binary policy categories. This demonstration is based on a study of the Sidi Okba oasis and the surrounding extensions. The results of this study first show that the binary framing of agricultural development in Algeria’s Sahara is inadequate, as it neglects the temporal and spatial continuities and the hybridity of both landscapes. However, the study also shows that binary policy categories, even when they are inaccurate, participate in the construction of the new Saharan agricultural realities. We conclude that the new extensions are a better-adapted version of the traditional oasis in the context of globalization but in continuity with the ancient oasis. Questions concerning the social, economic and environmental sustainability of this model remain to be answered.",9,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:107:y:2018:i:c:p:210-223,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.026,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v107y2018icp210-223.html,2020-03-09 19:46:07," 2018, Volume 107, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

The case of urban greenspace planning in Taipei Metropolis, Taiwan","['Mabon, Leslie', 'Shih, Wan-Yu']","This paper argues that climate change adaptation through strategic greenspace planning requires scholars and planners to think differently about what equity means in an urban greenspace context. We use the heat mitigation potential of greenspace and the case of Taipei Metropolis in Taiwan to assess challenges arising from thinking about fairness in terms of distribution of benefits from greenspace functions, as opposed to fairness in greenspace accessibility and availability. Urban greening to foster ‘resilient’ communities arguably deflects from – or even exacerbates – structural causes of vulnerability, with benefits accruing disproportionately to more affluent or empowered groups. Yet the need for practical action on climate threats in cities is urgent, and for heat, strategic greenspace use considered systematically across a city may mitigate effects through the cooling effect of vegetation. The challenge is thus to balance the justice concerns associated with urban greening with this tangible risk reduction potential.",19,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:107:y:2018:i:c:p:224-238,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.035,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v107y2018icp224-238.html,2020-03-09 19:46:11," 2018, Volume 107, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Skovgaard']","Empirical research on the impact of investment treaties has focused almost exclusively on their effect on foreign investment, with mixed results. Yet, another important promise of the treaties has been ignored altogether. Architects of the investment treaty regime, as well as many current proponents, have suggested that the treaties allow developing countries to de-politicize investor-state disputes; i.e. shield commercial disputes from broader political and diplomatic considerations with developed states. While this argument is widely accepted by legal scholars and practitioners and explicitly promoted by capital-exporting states, it has never been subjected to empirical investigation. We provide the first such test, using an original dataset of US diplomatic actions in 219 individual investment disputes across 73 countries as well as detailed case studies drawing on internal US State Department diplomatic cables. We find no evidence for the de-politicization hypothesis: diplomatic engagement remains important for investor-state dispute settlement, and the US government is just as likely to intervene in developing countries that have ratified investment treaties with the US as those that have not. Coercive American intervention in investment disputes is rare, but this is a general feature of American investment diplomacy after the Cold War, rather than one limited to investors with recourse to legalized dispute settlement procedures. These findings provide a critical corrective to our understanding of the investment treaty regime, and have important implications for understanding the effects of international legalization on developing countries.",19,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:107:y:2018:i:c:p:239-252,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.023,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v107y2018icp239-252.html,2020-03-09 19:46:15," 2018, Volume 107, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
632,Measuring livelihood resilience: The Household Livelihood Resilience Approach (HLRA),"['Quandt, Amy']","The concept of resilience, and livelihood resilience more specifically, is growing in prominence with international development and humanitarian organizations that aim to measure and build resilience to specific disturbances such as floods or droughts. However, measuring livelihood resilience is a difficult task, and practical methods to measure livelihood resilience, as well as analyze and visualize the data are needed. In this paper, I introduce the Household Livelihood Resilience Approach (HLRA), which draws from the sustainable livelihoods approach and it’s five capital assets to measure resilience. However, unlike other approaches that use the five capital assets such as utilized by Zurich Insurance Group, Ltd and the IFRC, the HLRA goes farther to help visualize the results and identify specific actions to build resilience. This paper illustrates the effectiveness of the HLRA through an empirical case study where this approach was used to measure livelihood resilience in Isiolo County, Kenya, and the effectiveness of agroforestry in building livelihood resilience for agricultural households. Drawing from this case study, I suggest five ways that the HLRA improves upon previous frameworks, including 1) providing practical methods and tools, not just a theoretical framework, 2) integrating ‘subjective’ measures of livelihood resilience, 3) focusing on the household-scale instead of community-scale or larger, 4) providing methods to analyze, visualize, and interpret results of livelihood resilience measures, and 5) highlighting the importance of human agency, power, and access to assets. The HLRA has the potential to help organizations identify specific interventions that could help build livelihood resilience for the most vulnerable groups of people within a community.",10,6,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:107:y:2018:i:c:p:253-263,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.024,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v107y2018icp253-263.html,2020-03-09 19:46:19," 2018, Volume 107, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
633,"Beyond dualism: Agricultural productivity, small towns, and structural change in Bangladesh","['Emran, M. Shahe', 'Shilpi, Forhad']","This paper uses a framework that goes beyond rural-urban dualism and highlights the role of small-town economy in understanding structural change in a developing country. It provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the role of agricultural productivity in structural transformation in the labor market in small towns and the surrounding rural areas. The empirical work is based on a general equilibrium model that formalizes the demand and labor market linkages: the small-town draws labor away from the rural areas to produce goods and services whose demand may depend largely on rural income. The theory clarifies the role played by the income elasticity of demand and the elasticity of wage with respect to productivity increase in agriculture. For productivity growth to lead to a demand effect, the wage elasticity has to be lower than a threshold. When the demand for goods and services produced in small towns comes mainly from the adjacent rural areas, the demand effect can outweigh the negative wage effect and lead to higher employment in the town-goods sector. The empirical analysis finds a significant positive effect of higher rainfall on rice yield and wages. Using rainfall shocks as a source of exogenous variation, we provide instrumental variables estimates of the effects of agricultural productivity on agricultural wages. The increase in wages is larger in the rural sample compared with the small town economy sample, but structural change in employment is more pronounced in the small town economy. In the rural sample, the positive employment effect is observed only in small-scale manufacturing and services. In contrast, a positive productivity shock in small towns sample has large and positive effect on employment in large scale manufacturing and services (construction, transport, education, and health). Agricultural productivity growth induces structural transformation within the services sector in small towns, with employment in skilled services growing at a faster pace than that in low skilled services.",21,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:107:y:2018:i:c:p:264-276,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.004,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v107y2018icp264-276.html,2020-03-09 19:46:22," 2018, Volume 107, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
634,Small and medium cities and development of Mexican rural areas,"['Berdegué, Julio A.', 'Soloaga, Isidro']","Like the rest of Latin America, Mexico is a highly-urbanized country. Yet rural populations, geographies and economic activities continue to play a significant role in national development, while there are persistent and large rural-urban inequalities in well-being and opportunities. Promoting rural-urban linkages has been proposed as a strategy to reduce spatial inequalities, but there is much academic and policy debate about whether urban development has positive (spread) or negative (backwash) effects on rural development. This could translate into synergistic or predatory urban-rural linkages. This study examines how proximity to cities, and population and per capita income in cities, affect population growth and welfare in rural places in Mexico. Using data for 2000 and 2010, our findings include: (a) 75% of rural people live within 90 min of an urban area, and 60% within 60 min; (b) proximity to a city increases rural population growth and welfare; (c) adverse (backwash) effects on rural areas due to increases in urban per capita income are very small and of no economic significance; (d) cities with populations in the 350,000–500,000 range appear to have more positive effects on rural areas than smaller or larger cities; (e) rural localities interact with multiple urban places simultaneously.",15,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:107:y:2018:i:c:p:277-288,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.007,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v107y2018icp277-288.html,2020-03-09 19:46:26," 2018, Volume 107, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
635,Climate change and gender equality in developing states,"['Eastin, Joshua']","It is commonly accepted that women can be more vulnerable than men to the adverse environmental effects of climate change. This paper evaluates whether the unequal distribution of costs women bear as a result of climate change are reflected across broader macro-social institutions to the detriment of gender equality and women's rights. It argues that gender disparities in climate change vulnerability not only reflect preexisting gender inequalities, they also reinforce them. Inequalities in the ownership and control of household assets and rising familial burdens due to male out-migration, declining food and water access, and increased disaster exposure can undermine women's ability to achieve economic independence, enhance human capital, and maintain health and wellbeing. Consequences for gender equality include reductions in intra-household bargaining power, as women become less capable of generating independent revenue. Outside the home, norms of gender discrimination and gender imbalances in socio-economic status should increase as women are less able to participate in formal labor markets, join civil society organizations, or collectively mobilize for political change. The outcome of these processes can reduce a society's level of gender equality by increasing constraints on the advancement of laws and norms that promote co-equal status. I empirically test this relationship across a sample of developing states between 1981 and 2010. The findings suggest that climate shocks and climatic disasters exert a broadly negative impact on gender equality, as deviations from long-term mean temperatures and increasing incidence of climatological and hydro-meteorological disasters are associated with declines in women's economic and social rights. These effects appear to be most salient in states that are relatively less-democratic, with greater dependence on agriculture, and lower levels of economic development.",20,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:107:y:2018:i:c:p:289-305,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.021,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v107y2018icp289-305.html,2020-03-09 19:46:30," 2018, Volume 107, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Drawing on the development and narratology literature, and employing computational linguistics (CL) techniques, this article compares the development narratives of 1076 Ashoka SEs across two periods (2009–2013 and 1994–1998) and two economies (developing and developed). CL analyses reveal important themes that characterize the identity, framing and orientations of development SEs across time and economies. The findings demonstrate how SE development narratives i) tend to be more pragmatic and solution-centric, and contain less political ideology than conventional development narratives, ii) combine extant development ideas and models but reframe them in new ways to address contemporary, complex development challenges, and iii) reflect a ‘bottom-up’ approach that encourages local ownership and collaborations with various social and economic sectors to achieve development goals.

We outline the creative ways that households and their members have sought to address the scissor effects of declining land holdings, rising needs, reduced relative returns to agriculture, and often precarious non-farm work. We posit, drawing on this work from Thailand, that while Asia’s ‘truncated agrarian transition’ goes some way to explaining the current empirical fact of persistent smallholders, we raise doubts whether the rural development agenda of modernisation, marketisation and rural exit will have the traction that governments and some scholars anticipate. A focus on production obscures how rural livelihoods also embody acts of consumption, care, reproduction and redistribution. Our study finds that the current experience of occupational multiplicity where households’ livelihoods comprise farm and non-farm, commoditised and quasi-subsistence, in situ and ex situ, production and care, and reproduction and redistribution will likely also persist, if non-farm occupations remains classically precarious and social safety nets thinly woven.

Our main learning is a rather surprising fact that at a lower level of security expenditure in the violence affected area, an increase in security expenditures leads to an increase in violent incidents (rather than a decrease); and only at higher level of security expenditure in the area, an increase in security expenditure leads to a decline in violent incidents. For the analysis, we use a novel dataset on naxalite violence obtained directly from the police head-quarters of the three most affected states in India. The data consists of 64 districts spanning over years 2001 till 2013 and includes information on the annual number of violent incidents and the size of the security forces allocated specifically to curb the naxalite violence. We use negative binomial regression model with the number of violent incidents as the dependent variable and lagged size of security forces as the independent variable, while controlling for other relevant variables.

Since its establishment in 2003, a large number of resource-dependent countries have committed to the EITI Standard, and support of the EITI from donors, nongovernmental organizations, and extractive industry companies has been vast. To understand whether and how adherence to the EITI Standard can affect resource governance and development, it is crucial to examine what factors influence a country’s decision to join and implement the Standard. This article examines why and how rapidly countries adopt the Standard using survival analysis methods and a global dataset on countries’ progress in implementing the EITI Standard. It finds that several factors influence progress and proposes that these can be categorized as internal motivation, internal capacity, and external pressure to implement the Standard. This article contributes to understanding why the EITI Standard implementation stalls in some countries whereas it progresses in others. Importantly, it outlines which factors need to be controlled for in studies that seek to evaluate the impact of the EITI on resource governance and societal development, and argues that such impact evaluations need to correct for the selection biases in countries’ decisions to commit to and implement the EITI Standard.",18,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:107:y:2018:i:c:p:358-381,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.030,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v107y2018icp358-381.html,2020-03-09 19:46:44," 2018, Volume 107, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
640,Exposure to firewood: Consequences for health and labor force participation in Mexico,"['Stabridis, Omar', 'van Gameren, Edwin']","Indoor air pollution (IAP) originating from firewood used as cooking fuel relates to respiratory problems and can generate economic losses. IAP is associated with 1.6 million deaths worldwide annually. We assess the mechanisms behind the cooking fuel choice – in particular, firewood or LPG –, if the exposure to IAP due to firewood usage causes respiratory problems, and if this has implications for the probability to participate in the labor market. A small economic-theoretical model is proposed in which an individual maximizes utility generated by the fuel choice, consumption, health status, and the time dedicated to health and leisure, under financial and time constraints. For an empirical test, we use the 2002 Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS), estimating a trivariate recursive probit model. Our study finds that the usage of firewood as the household's fuel for cooking results in an increased prevalence of respiratory problems among women (but not among men), probably related to the traditional duties in the household. In the labor participation decision, we find a negative impact of respiratory problems on participation; hence, especially for women we find a strong causal channel from exposure to IAP to health problems to a reduction of labor force participation. A possible policy to break the circle of negative effects could involve the provision of improved firewood or LPG stoves that provoke less pollution and therefore reduces the health risks.",49,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:107:y:2018:i:c:p:382-395,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.03.009,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v107y2018icp382-395.html,2020-03-09 19:46:48," 2018, Volume 107, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
641,Do special economic zones induce developmental spillovers? Evidence from India’s states,"['Alkon, Meir']","Do special economic zones induce local development? Research drawing on the case of China’s special economic zones suggests that subnational polities can target the location of export zones in order to catalyze local and regional socioeconomic development. Since 2006, a number of Indian states have pushed forward similar zones in the face of accusations of land grabbing, arguing that the zones will be engines for improvement in exports, employment, and infrastructure. I argue that local development spillovers are an important, albeit previously understudied, dimension by which to evaluate the effects of special economic zones. I then present the first systematic analysis of the developmental effects of India’s SEZs, leveraging an original dataset on their locations, together with 2001 and 2011 census data containing a host of social and economic developmental variables. The findings show these SEZs have failed to bring about local socioeconomic development. To explain this absence of developmental spillovers, I provide a theoretical framework based on the crucial role of political economy incentive structures facing local politicians. I outline the mechanism through which Indian state politicians use state-owned development corporations for rent capture, undermining the potential effectiveness of SEZs and leading to their developmental failures. The combination of available means for extracting rents and the limited political constraints on such rent extraction leads to a lack of developmental spillovers. This framework can also help to explain the difference in the effects of SEZs in India and in China. These findings have theoretical importance for understanding the conditions under which subnational polities can use export zones and other export policies to catalyze development, and practical implications for understanding the mixed pattern of SEZ success across the world.",31,4,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:107:y:2018:i:c:p:396-409,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.028,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v107y2018icp396-409.html,2020-03-09 19:46:51," 2018, Volume 107, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

We use time and geographic variation in weather and show that hot weather in the previous year worsens psychological well-being among rural, but not urban, Indian adults. We examine potential mechanisms and show that the effect is largely driven by hot temperatures during the agricultural season and could be partly attributed to a reduction in agricultural production. We further provide suggestive evidence that the effects of weather shocks could be mitigated with poverty reduction programs such as India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Poor mental health has been associated with low productivity and high healthcare expenditures and is a serious concern in India and many developing countries. The adverse impacts of climate change on rural, agriculture-based economies such as India are likely to increase over time.

We show empirically that borrowers who bought additional life insurance coverage were significantly more likely to fully repay their loan, and were allowed to receive higher loan amounts, even after controlling for borrower health and other determinants of loan repayment and insurance purchase. The relationship is stronger in magnitude for new borrowers’ first loan than for their second loan, and in several situations in which borrowers would have a higher incentive to signal their creditworthiness. We interpret this evidence as borrowers signaling their creditworthiness (or quality) by purchasing costly insurance in an environment subject to a high level of information asymmetries and devoid of credible tools to demonstrate creditworthiness.",16,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:106:y:2018:i:c:p:40-50,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.01.025,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v106y2018icp40-50.html,2020-03-09 19:47:06," 2018, Volume 106, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
646,The promise and peril of paralegal aid,"['Swenson, Geoffrey']","Strengthening the rule of law and promoting access to justice in developing countries have been longstanding international policy objectives. However, the standard policy tools, such as technical assistance and material aid, are routinely criticized for failing to achieve their objectives. The rare exception is paralegal aid, which is almost universally lauded by policymakers and scholars as effective in promoting the rule of law and access to justice. This belief, however, rests on a very limited empirical foundation regarding what paralegal programs accomplish and under what theory they operate. This paper critically examines the conventional wisdom surrounding paralegal initiatives through case studies of two successful paralegal programs in post-conflict Timor-Leste that are broadly representative of the type of initiatives commonly implemented in developing countries. These programs did improve access to justice services, bolster choice between dispute resolution forums, and increase local knowledge of progressive norms on human rights and women’s rights. Yet, as this article shows, even successful programs can expect to achieve only incremental gains in promoting the rule of law because advances largely depend on alignment with the priorities of powerful state and non-state actors, donors, program implementers, and paralegals themselves. To date, the literature has not acknowledged these limitations. This article addresses this gap by demonstrating that paralegal aid faces multiple challenges that mean paralegals cannot necessarily transcend or modify deep seated norms and power structures. These issues include principal agent-problems due to the extensive delegation required, internal limitations resulting from paralegals’ limited authority and independence, and external constraints from state and non-state justice actors. Paralegal programs also face program design, implementation, and sustainability challenges. Consequently, scholars, practitioners, and policymakers need to adopt a more balanced view of paralegal aid.",5,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:106:y:2018:i:c:p:51-63,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.01.017,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v106y2018icp51-63.html,2020-03-09 19:47:10," 2018, Volume 106, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Advances made by the Colombian government to achieve greater security within the country – putting an end to the long-standing armed conflict – and to promote ecotourism can help position Colombia as one of the most important bird watching destinations worldwide. This study estimates the economic benefits from bird-based tourism in post-war Colombia. In particular, we estimate the value that members of the US-based National Audubon Society place on a birding tour that includes the participation of local communities (some of whom were victims of the armed conflict), and visits to important areas for bird watching that are increasingly accessible. The study also approximates the demand for international bird watching tourism to the country. Through the application of the contingent valuation method, we show that birding enthusiasts would be willing to pay, on average, an additional $58 per person per day for a tour in Colombia, as compared to a similar tour in terms of duration and services in Costa Rica, currently one of the main tourism destinations for birdwatchers. Our analysis indicates that a total of 278,850 North American bird watchers would be interested in visiting the country, generating an annual profit of $9 million and 7516 new jobs. In addition to confirming demand for bird-based travel, the study provides information about potential visitors’ preferences, which can help guide the development of a strategy to promote bird-based tourism to Colombia.",5,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:106:y:2018:i:c:p:78-86,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.01.015,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v106y2018icp78-86.html,2020-03-09 19:47:17," 2018, Volume 106, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Using an analytical framework relying on political settlement and ideas, it engages in process-tracing of the critical policy choices of the CBHI development. The study finds that the commitment to expanding health insurance coverage was made possible by a dominant political settlement.

To attain this goal, the central government has set up a range of programs, such as incentive programs, teacher grants and infrastructure grants, while state governments share responsibility in implementing those educational policy initiatives. This paper reviews the progress of India’s primary schools over the period 2005–2011 as public educational undertaking shifted more from the centre to the states. Using two waves of the Indian Human Development Survey conducted in 2005 and 2011, we track the progress of primary schools in terms of infrastructure upgrade, teachers’ quality, the costs of education, enrolment and learning outcomes. We find that while progress has been made in terms of infrastructure provision and enrolment, other aspects have either seen no progress or have worsened over time, and numerical and reading skills of children 8–11 years old worsening over time.

We take a critical look at current efforts to measure women’s empowerment at the individual/household level through standardized tools. We examine the results of a household survey conducted in Nepal using the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), which was developed as a monitoring and evaluation tool for the Feed the Future Initiative. Our interpretation of the results is informed by qualitative fieldwork conducted in the same region. In our quantitative analysis, we regress correlates of empowerment identified in the literature, such as age, education, household wealth, income, and household composition, on individual empowerment as measured by the WEAI. While several factors associated with women’s empowerment are significantly associated, household composition and intra-household relationships, which we expected to be essential factors in the local context, appear to be unrelated to the WEAI empowerment score. A measure of critical consciousness tested alongside the WEAI instrument appears instead to be closely associated with these factors. Our qualitative findings reveal that there is a discrepancy between local meanings of empowerment and definitions of empowerment defined in terms of agency. Based on these results, we suggest that improvements in measurement may be possible if approaches that measure power predominantly in terms of agency or decision-making were to include critical consciousness in their framework.",28,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:106:y:2018:i:c:p:111-123,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.002,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v106y2018icp111-123.html,2020-03-09 19:47:28," 2018, Volume 106, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

In this study, I examine whether and how FISP has affected dietary diversity in household food consumption and child nutrition. I find that children under the age of five living in households that received a voucher between 2008 and 2013 for the purchase of fertilizer have a statistically significantly higher (at the 1% level) weight-for-age, weight-for-length/height and body mass index than children living in non-recipient households. I also find that households having received a voucher consume cereals, nuts, vegetables, meats and fruits more frequently than non-recipient households. The analysis uses two stage least squares to account for the endogeneity of selection into the fertilizer subsidy program. I test the robustness of these results using child fixed effects.

Our econometric methodology borrows from developments in the empirical trade literature to accommodate a dataset with numerous zero-value observations.

We present a causal framework that can be used to identify leaks and blockages in the information production and dissemination process in such programs. We conceptualize the “information pipeline” as a series of connected nodes, each of which constitutes a possible point of blockage. We apply the framework to a field-experimental evaluation of a program that provided households in Bangalore, India, with advance notification of intermittently provided piped water. Our study detected no impacts on household wait times for water or on how citizens viewed the state, but found that notifications reduced stress. Our framework reveals that, in our case, noncompliance among human intermediaries and asymmetric gender relations contributed in large part to these null-to-modest results.

This paper evaluates the effect of the PFD to mitigate poverty among the state’s rural Indigenous (Alaska Native) peoples: a population with historically high poverty rates living in a region with limited economic opportunities. Errors in recording PFD income in data used to calculate official poverty statistics cause them to misrepresent poverty in Alaska and understate the effect of the PFD. Estimating poverty rates with and without PFD income therefore requires reconstruction of family incomes from household-level data. Estimated poverty rates from reconstructed income show that the PFD has had a substantial, although diminishing mitigating effect on poverty for rural Indigenous families. The PFD has had a larger effect on poverty among children and elders than for the rural Alaska Native population as a whole. Alaska Native seniors, who receive additional sources of UBI derived primarily from resource rents besides the PFD, have seen a decline in poverty rates, while poverty rates for children have increased.

There is already a well-established body of literature in public finance, which argues that intergovernmental grants “crowd out” local revenues. Most existing studies, however, explore the fiscal implications of intergovernmental transfers in high-income countries where sound fiscal systems are taken for granted. In this paper, I explore the impact of intergovernmental transfers on local revenues in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where local fiscal capacity is limited and endogenously determined by financial support from international donors and the central government. I argue that in places where the existing capacity of LGAs to administer tax collection is weak and political costs of enforcing taxation are low—which are perennial features of many rural districts in Africa—intergovernmental transfers facilitate local revenue generation instead of undermining it. Analyzing newly available quarterly fiscal data on local revenues in Tanzania, I show that intergovernmental grants improve the mobilization of local revenues, and also that the positive effect of fiscal transfers on local revenue collection seems to be more pronounced in rural districts.",42,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:106:y:2018:i:c:p:173-186,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.01.026,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v106y2018icp173-186.html,2020-03-09 19:47:47," 2018, Volume 106, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Effects of foreign direct investments (FDI) on internal conflict","[""Mihalache-O'Keef, Andreea S.""]","This paper investigates the influence of foreign direct investments on the probability of civil conflict onset, contributing to the debate on globalization and civil conflict. I relax the common assumption that all forms of globalization are equivalent in their effects on civil conflict. I also incorporate the cross-sectoral heterogeneity of investments in existing arguments about the socioeconomic externalities of foreign direct investments as determinants of conflict. With long time horizons and managerial control of their foreign affiliates, foreign direct investors are strategic players aiming to maximize profits and uniquely able to alter their environment through socio-political channels. This distinguishes FDI from trade and foreign portfolio investments. Through a combination of political agency and socio-economic influences on grievance and greed among domestic groups, some types of FDI are likely to alleviate the risk of civil conflict (service sector FDI), while others exacerbate it (primary sector FDI). Analyses using a new data set of sector-specific FDI stock, 1980–2013, lend empirical support to the argument.

Findings reveal that the meaning of education equates to the capacity to aspire to a different life.

Using female membership in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as a measure for women’s political participation and relying on data provided by Chinese county chronicles, we show that female political participation in 1950 had a long-term and positive impact on gender equality of education in 1990. Relying on individual-level data provided by the 1990 census, we construct a panel dataset comprising of people of different age cohorts in individual counties and find that contemporary women’s political participation significantly narrows the gender gap by raising girls’ probability of enrollment and completion of school relative to those of boys. The positive effects remain when we use the time of “liberation”, i.e., the time when the CCP got control of a county, to construct an instrument for the female party membership in 1950 and future periods. These effects also remain significant when the period of Cultural Revolution is studied. Finally, we test two channels, the policy channel and the perception channel, by which these effects were possibly exerted.

Considering China’s tendency to maintain control over development projects throughout the entire implementation phase, using Chinese contractors for work performed in the recipient countries, the present paper investigates whether China impacts African labour practices in their capacity as a donor. Specifically, we use a new data material allowing for systematic quantitative analysis of Chinese development finance to investigate whether Chinese development projects affect trade union involvement. Matching geo-referenced data on the subnational allocation of Chinese development projects to Africa over the 2000–2012 period with 41,902 survey respondents across 18 African countries, our estimation strategy relies on comparing the trade union involvement of individuals who live near a site where a Chinese project is being implemented at the time of the interview to those of individuals living near a site where a Chinese project will appear in the future, but where implementation had yet to be initiated at the time of the survey. The results consistently indicate that Chinese development projects – unlike the projects of other major donors – discourage trade union involvement in the local area.",25,4,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:106:y:2018:i:c:p:284-298,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.003,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v106y2018icp284-298.html,2020-03-09 19:48:17," 2018, Volume 106, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
665,Is women’s empowerment associated with political knowledge and opinions? Evidence from rural Mali,"['Bleck, Jaimie', 'Michelitch, Kristin']","According to many prominent theorists of democracy, citizens must be able to “formulate and signify preferences” to participate as ‘political equals’ for democracy to work (Dahl, 1971). However, a gender gap in political knowledge and opinions exists across the Global South, especially in rural areas. In this paper, we study the relationship between rural women’s socioeconomic empowerment (household agency and mobility outside the village) and political knowledge and opinions in Mali, a West African country with patriarchal gender norms. To reduce well-known difficulties of gaining access to rural women and reducing bystander effects, we use simultaneous co-gender interviews of one man and one woman per extended family household and a modified Audio-Self-Administered Questionnaire for illiterate populations. Further to reduce “satisficed” opinions, we elicit opinion justifications and measure “justified opinions.” Consistent with predictions, we find that women’s empowerment is positively associated with rural women’s political knowledge and opinions. We close by examining opinions towards one controversial policy area with redistributive consequences for men and women—the Family Code, which regulates rights of men and women in marriage, inheritance, and the family. More empowered women are more likely to support pro-woman changes.",15,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:106:y:2018:i:c:p:299-323,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.01.006,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v106y2018icp299-323.html,2020-03-09 19:48:20," 2018, Volume 106, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
666,"Identifying the essential ingredients to literacy and numeracy improvement: Teacher professional development and coaching, student textbooks, and structured teachers’ guides","['Piper, Benjamin', 'Simmons Zuilkowski, Stephanie', 'Dubeck, Margaret', 'Jepkemei, Evelyn', 'King, Simon J.']","Several rigorously evaluated programs have recently shown positive effects on early literacy and numeracy outcomes in developing countries. However, these programs have not been designed to evaluate which ingredients of the interventions are most essential to improve literacy outcomes. Policy makers therefore lack evidence as to whether program ingredients such as teacher professional development (PD), instructional coaching, learner materials, teachers’ guides, community support, or technology are required for program impact. The Kenya Primary Math and Reading Initiative was a randomized controlled trial that compared three treatment groups with specific ingredients and a control group. Using literacy and numeracy outcome measures for grades 1 and 2, we evaluated the benefits of the following ingredients: (1) teacher PD and teacher instructional support and coaching; (2) revised student books in literacy and numeracy, at a 1:1 ratio, added to PD and instructional support; and (3) structured teacher lesson plans added to student books, PD, and instructional support. We found that two of the three combinations of ingredients had statistically significant positive impacts on learning outcomes. The results showed that the third combination—PD, teacher instructional support and coaching, 1:1 student books, and structured teacher lesson plans—was most effective. A cost-effectiveness analysis on the ingredients showed that the option of PD and instructional support, 1:1 revised books, and teachers’ guides was the most expensive, but that the additional impact on learning made this the most cost-effective intervention. This study rigorously analyzes which ingredients for literacy and numeracy improvement would be most effective for overall impact, and suggests to policy makers that careful decisions regarding program ingredients will lead to more effectively designed and implemented interventions to improve learning in developing countries.",14,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:106:y:2018:i:c:p:324-336,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.01.018,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v106y2018icp324-336.html,2020-03-09 19:48:24," 2018, Volume 106, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
667,Blessing and curse. The gold boom and local development in Colombia,"['Santos, Rafael J.']","I provide a microeconomic channel for the resource curse using the boom in Colombian gold mining as a case study. Identification strategies exploit trend changes in international gold prices after 2002 and regional gold production capabilities as measured by water supply (the majority of gold mining in Colombia is placer mining and water is important for industrial gold production). I find that the gold boom decreases local unemployment in the short term by 3.5%. However, given the lack of capacity to effectively ban child labor, these economic opportunities are also available for children. My results indicate that, because of the gold boom, the probability that a child works increases by 9.3% and school attendance decreases by 23.9%. Capital accumulation seems to be permanently hurt since the probability that a child is lagging three or more grades behind increases by 9%. These effects are only discernible after 2002. The human capital results can be retrieved from different databases. Furthermore, results are robust to a series of robustness checks (restricting the sample to gold producers and their neighbors, using alternative sets of controls and restricting the sample to non-migrants).

668,Parlez-vous français? Language and agricultural aid allocation strategies in northern Mali,"['Maiden, Emily', 'Brockway, Mark']","In January 2012, insurgent groups in northern Mali began a violent campaign against the central government. By March 2012, then-President Amadou Toumani Touré (ATT) was ousted in a successful coup. The ongoing unrest has drastically shifted the strategies foreign donors are using to allocate aid, particularly to northern Mali. While bilateral donors have drastically scaled back all programmatic aid, NGOs including Oxfam International and the Red Cross have stepped in to provide humanitarian aid. This shift from programmatic to humanitarian aid has left the agricultural sector particularly vulnerable. Since most of the food grown in Mali is grown in the northern region, such a drastic decrease in agricultural aid will have catastrophic effects in terms of projected food shortages. Furthermore, using evidence from new World Bank survey data gathered in northern Mali in 2015, we find that the agricultural aid being distributed by NGOs is not targeting those most in need. We find that French-speaking villages are more likely to be targeted for aid compared to non-French-speaking villages. We argue that in northern Mali, under the current sociopolitical conditions, speaking French makes these villages more attractive to aid organizations, regardless of their actual need for assistance. This appropriation principle means that aid is not going to the most vulnerable, but to the most politically or socially connected. We also find proof of a second layer of aid misappropriation. While Sonrai and Tamasheq-speaking villages receive less agricultural aid than French-speaking villages, the aid they do receive goes to those households most vulnerable to exogenous shocks. However, in French-speaking villages, the most vulnerable households are not guaranteed to receive agricultural aid. If desperately needed agricultural aid continues to be misappropriated, it could lead countries like Mali to become even more unstable.",25,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:106:y:2018:i:c:p:356-375,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.015,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v106y2018icp356-375.html,2020-03-09 19:48:32," 2018, Volume 106, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Unclear and conflicting tenure has been the main challenge faced by the proponents of subnational REDD+ initiatives, and accordingly, they have expended much effort to remedy the problem. This article assesses how well REDD+ has performed in laying an appropriate tenure foundation. Field research was carried out in two phases (2010–2012 and 2013–2014) in five countries (Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia) at 21 subnational initiatives, 141 villages (half targeted for REDD+ interventions), and 3,754 households. Three questions are posed: 1) What was the effect of REDD+ on perceived tenure insecurity of village residents?; 2) What are the main reasons for change in the level of tenure insecurity and security from Phase 1 to Phase 2 perceived by village residents in control and intervention villages?; and 3) How do intervention village residents evaluate the impact of tenure-related interventions on community well-being? Among the notable findings are that: 1) tenure insecurity decreases slightly across the whole sample of villages, but we only find that REDD+ significantly reduces tenure insecurity in Cameroon, while actually increasing insecurity of smallholder agricultural land tenure in Brazil at the household level; 2) among the main reported reasons for increasing tenure insecurity (where it occurs) are problems with outside companies, lack of title, and competition from neighboring villagers; and 3) views on the effect of REDD+ tenure-related interventions on community well-being lean towards the positive, including for interventions that restrain access to forest. Thus, while there is little evidence that REDD+ interventions have worsened smallholder tenure insecurity (as feared by critics), there is also little evidence that the proponents’ efforts to address tenure insecurity have produced results. Work on tenure remains an urgent priority for safeguarding local livelihoods as well as for reducing deforestation. This will require increased attention to participatory engagement, improved reward systems, tenure policy reform, integration of national and local efforts, and “business-as-usual” interests.",15,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:106:y:2018:i:c:p:376-392,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.01.010,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v106y2018icp376-392.html,2020-03-09 19:48:35," 2018, Volume 106, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

While cities and, in particular, secondary towns, where most of the urban population in sub-Saharan Africa resides, affect agricultural practices in their rural hinterlands, this relationship is not well understood. To fill this gap, we develop a conceptual model to analyze how farmers’ proximity to cities of different sizes affects agricultural prices and intensification of farming. We then test these predictions using large-scale survey data from producers of teff, a major staple crop in Ethiopia, relying on unique data on transport costs and road networks and implementing an array of econometric models. We find that agricultural price behavior and intensification is determined by proximity to a city and the type of city. While proximity to cities has a strong positive effect on agricultural output prices and on uptake of modern inputs and yields on farms, the effects on prices and intensification measures are lower for farmers in the rural hinterlands of secondary towns compared to primate cities.",39,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:106:y:2018:i:c:p:393-406,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.03.006,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v106y2018icp393-406.html,2020-03-09 19:48:39," 2018, Volume 106, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

One way that local elites capture community-driven development is to limit information about opportunities for citizens to shape group decisions. We investigate whether sending citizens targeted and timely information about when and how they can participate in the planning of community-driven development projects increases knowledge, participation, and satisfaction with local institutions. We implemented a pre-registered randomized field experiment in partnership with the Uganda Wildlife Authority that involved sending residents in randomly selected villages near Bwindi National Park approximately 60 messages by mobile phone over eight months about how a park-sponsored revenue sharing program worked and how and when residents could participate. We do not find evidence that the information increased perceived knowledge, participation, perceived efficacy, or satisfaction with local institutions. Exploratory findings suggest that among women, who are often disenfranchised in Ugandan society, the information treatment backfired related to perceived opportunities to participate. More positively, we find that reaching more people in a community with information led to promising results related to participation and satisfaction with the park.

It also evaluates how three important aspects of the fiscal exchange—trust in government, perceptions of the public good, and level of income—shape the effect of these design features. Based on an original survey experiment focusing on the provision of public safety in Mexico, I find that these design features increase political support for taxation, especially among those with low trust in government and low income.

A correlated random effects (CRE) device is used, and consistency and robustness of results are checked using various other estimation models. The receipt of fertilizer and seed subsidies is shown to have an inconsistent impact on farm productivity and food security; at the same time, access to agricultural advice is consistently insignificant in explaining these. Further analysis, however, shows a statistically significant and strong association with farm productivity and food security when access to extension services is unpacked to include indicators of usefulness and farmers’ satisfaction. Households that reported receipt of “very useful” agricultural advice had greater productivity and greater food security compared to those that reported receipt of advice that they considered not useful and those that did not receive any advice at all.

A common understanding is that religion depresses women’s rights in general and reproductive and abortion rights in particular. The literature on reproductive rights, however, is disproportionately focused on Western cases, and is limited in its definition of religion as a variable. What happens, though, when we switch to a more inclusive framework? To what extent do a variety of religious variables correlate with policy on reproductive rights outside of the Western context? We examine the relevance of the religion-abortion link in a broad comparative framework. We introduce the Comparative Abortion Index and test the effects of a wide range of denominations and religious characteristics on reproductive rights. Our study finds that reproductive rights correlate only with some religious denominations, while others have no significance. Additionally, while religiosity correlates with reproductive policy, variables such as religious freedom, separation of religion and state and religious diversity show no correlative effect.

Micro-level evidence from Nigeria,"['Kotsadam, Andreas', 'Østby, Gudrun', 'Rustad, Siri Aas', 'Tollefsen, Andreas Forø', 'Urdal, Henrik']","While there is a vast literature studying the effects of official development aid (ODA) on economic growth, there are far fewer comparative studies addressing how aid affects health outcomes. Furthermore, while much attention has been paid to country-level effects of aid, there is a clear knowledge gap in the literature when it comes to systematic studies of aid effectiveness below the country-level. Addressing this gap, we undertake what we believe is the first systematic attempt to study how ODA affects infant mortality at the subnational level. We match new geographic aid data from the AidData on the precise location, type, and time frame of bilateral and multilateral aid projects in Nigeria with available georeferenced survey data from five Nigerian Demographic and Health Surveys. Using quasi-experimental approaches, with mother fixed-effects, we are able to control for a vast number of unobserved factors that may otherwise be spuriously correlated with both infant mortality and ODA. The results indicate very clearly that geographical proximity to active aid projects reduces infant mortality. Moreover, aid contributes to reduce systematic inter-group, or horizontal, inequalities in a setting where such differences loom large. In particular, we find that aid more effectively reduces infant mortality in less privileged groups like children of Muslim women, and children living in rural, and in Muslim-dominated areas. Finally, there is evidence that aid projects are established in areas that on average have lower infant mortality than non-aid locations, suggesting that there are biases resulting in aid not necessarily reaching those populations in greatest need.",40,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:105:y:2018:i:c:p:59-69,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.12.022,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v105y2018icp59-69.html,2020-03-09 19:49:01," 2018, Volume 105, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

This paper provides an assessment of two key dimensions: the global adoption of MDGs and state capacity. We do so by studying whether they facilitated convergence in income poverty measures, using cross-section and panel methods, with data on 89 developing economies for the period 1990–2013. We find that poverty headcount and gap measures tended to decrease faster in countries with initially higher income poverty. Such convergence accelerated after 2000, suggesting that MDGs adoption was instrumental to poverty reduction. However, this still leaves unexplained substantial variation in poverty reduction performance across countries. Such variation is explained by state capacity: countries with greater ability to administer their territories in 1990 experienced faster income poverty reduction and were more likely to have achieved the MDG target. This result is insensitive to robust regression methods and to a large set of controls (initial level of income, dependence on natural resources, education and health inputs, dependence on foreign aid, ethnic fractionalization, regional effects and a set of governance variables).

New evidence from a survey in China,"['Shao, Shuai', 'Tian, Zhihua', 'Fan, Meiting']","The majority of existing studies argue that rich people and the residents in high-income countries and regions have stronger willingness to pay (WTP) for environmental protection. Does such a rule hold true for China at the present stage? Previous studies pay little attention to this issue due to the lack of related data. Merging the micro data from the Chinese General Social Survey in 2010 (CGSS2010) with the macro data at the corresponding urban level of China, as well as two types of satellite monitoring data, this paper investigates the effect of income on residents’ WTP for environmental protection at both macro and micro perspectives based on the ordered Logit model. The results show that the rich do have stronger WTP for environmental protection. However, with the increase in residents’ income, the marginal WTP for environmental protection will decline, and a reversal occurs at the top income level. Therefore, the WTP does not always rise with the increase in income, and the middle-income class has the strongest WTP for environmental protection. Moreover, after controlling individual characteristics, residents’ WTP for environmental protection more depends on environmental pollution degree rather than urban average income level measured by both GDP per capita and the nighttime lights data from satellite monitoring. The residents in more polluted cities have stronger WTP for environmental protection.

This paper describes the main mechanisms through which demographic change may affect economic outcomes, and estimates the association between changes in the share of working-age population with per capita growth and poverty rate.

It has been suggested that when evaluating the impact of an intervention, the affected population should be allowed to define well-being (requiring a subjective measure), and impacts (requiring a participatory approach), but very few, if any, conservation evaluations live up to these standards. We used a participatory impact evaluation approach with the Global Person Generated Index (GPGI) to investigate the relative impacts of strict protection and community forest management on local well-being in Madagascar’s rainforests. The GPGI captures the subjective and multidimensional nature of well-being by asking respondents to identify the five most important domains for their quality of life, to evaluate their own performance in each domain, and the relative importance of the five identified domains. Participatory impact evaluation establishes local perceptions of the cause-effect relationship between an intervention and respondents’ performance in each domain. Over half the respondents perceived no positive or negative impacts from the conservation interventions. We found no significant difference between strict protection and community forest management in the measures we used to examine the magnitude of their relative impacts, but there were differences in the characteristics of domains impacted and in the priority domains that could be targeted to improve well-being in locally meaningful ways. Because of its subjectivity, the GPGI cannot provide quantitative information on the magnitude of impacts.

681,From worker to peasant and then to entrepreneur? Land reform and agrarian change in the Saïss (Morocco),"['Petit, Olivier', 'Kuper, Marcel', 'Ameur, Fatah']","The aim of this paper is to analyze the emerging entrepreneurial practices on family farms in two agrarian reform cooperatives in Morocco. Their emergence can be explained by the constant negotiation of multiple and sometimes even antagonistic logics within these farms in a context of rapid agrarian change and the juxtaposition of capitalistic, entrepreneurial and peasant farms in the same area. Through their engagement as workers or sharecroppers in the different types of farms and as household members on the family farm, the young farmers from the dismantled agrarian cooperatives participate actively in the transformation of farming modes. The porosity of the peasant and entrepreneurial worlds is the main lesson we draw from our study. There is a subtle process of hybridization between the peasant and entrepreneurial modes of farming, resulting in a wide range of profiles. If we only focus on the political discourse, the trend towards capitalistic and entrepreneurial modes of farming seems inescapable. Nevertheless, our study stresses the resistance of peasant modes of farming that can blend with a ‘modern’ perception of agriculture.",8,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:105:y:2018:i:c:p:119-131,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.12.031,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v105y2018icp119-131.html,2020-03-09 19:49:20," 2018, Volume 105, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to determine which trajectories changed where, and to what scale of human consequence. We perform three empirical assessments: a count of countries that accelerated their rate of progress post-2000; statistical t-tests for differences in mean country rates of progress; and a determination of the incremental lives saved or improved (or not) due to accelerated progress above pre-MDG trends. We find that low-income countries and sub-Saharan African countries had positive acceleration on a majority of indicators and accounted for much of the world’s post-2000 accelerations. Middle-income countries typically registered larger cumulative gains but less acceleration over the period. The greatest advances were in matters of life and death. At least 20.9 million and as many as 30.3 million additional lives were saved due to accelerated rates of progress, with sub-Saharan Africa accounting for approximately two-thirds of the total. Primary school completion also showed considerable overall acceleration, leading to at least 74 million more children having finished primary school. Other measures of basic needs – including undernourishment, access to water and access to sanitation – showed mixed patterns of acceleration.

Even today, the world faces the prospect of several of these crises occurring simultaneously. Yet despite their persistence, there is no agreed model for the development of famines, making it difficult to detect their emergence and to prevent their occurrence. Examining a diverse range of historical and contemporary crises, this paper argues that the evolution of famines can be identified by a set of recognizable elements: pressure, hold, self-reinforcing dynamics, famine system, and rebalancing. It suggests that severe pressure on a population, when held in place for sufficient time, leads to self-reinforcing dynamics that can eventually organize into a famine system that rapidly causes high levels of mortality, until it re-balances and collapses. It contends that this famine systems model can provide analytical insight into the development of most famines and can potentially be used to better identify and respond to these crises in the future.",5,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:105:y:2018:i:c:p:144-155,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.12.028,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v105y2018icp144-155.html,2020-03-09 19:49:27," 2018, Volume 105, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

It aims to overcome the limitations of existing empirical literature by building a new urban population dataset that allows the construction of a set of Herfindahl-Hirschman-Indices which capture a country’s urban structure in a more nuanced way than the indicators used hitherto. We find that, contrary to the general perception, urban concentration levels have on average decreased or remained stable (depending on indicator). However, these averages camouflage diverging trends across countries. The results of the econometric analysis suggest that there is no uniform relationship between urban concentration and economic growth. Urban concentration is beneficial for economic growth in high-income countries, while this effect does not hold for developing countries.

Drawing on the work of economists, political scientists, sociologists, and anthropologists, we examine seven policy categories: (1) rewards and penalties; (2) monitoring; (3) restructuring bureaucracies; (4) screening and recruiting; (5) anti-corruption agencies; (6) educational campaigns; and (7) international agreements. Notably, rigorous empirical evaluation is lacking for the majority of commonly prescribed anti-corruption policies. Nevertheless, we find growing evidence of the effectiveness of policies based on monitoring, including anti-corruption audits and e-governance. In addition, adequate civil service wages seem to be a necessary but insufficient condition for control of corruption.

This has important implications for many cross-country comparisons, including measures of poverty and inequality. Without presuming that either round is better methodologically, the paper tries to help the community of ICP users better understand the economic factors underlying the estimated changes in price levels across countries. Differences in domestic inflation rates have played a role, as expected. Two other factors are identified. The excess sensitivity to changes in market exchange rates suggests that the PPPs may put higher weight on internationally traded goods than do domestic deflators. Additionally, faster growing countries have seen a steeper rise in their PPP relative to market exchange rates; this can be explained by a tendency for wage increases in growing economies to lead to a higher price level. Together these factors account for over 70% of the variance in PPP changes even ignoring methodological changes. However, an independent downward drift in price levels is also evident, concentrated in the ICP’s Asia region. A possible explanation lies in the Asia region’s greater success (relative to other regions) in removing urban bias in the price surveys.",21,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:105:y:2018:i:c:p:201-216,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.12.035,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v105y2018icp201-216.html,2020-03-09 19:49:42," 2018, Volume 105, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

It contains district inequality measures based on household income reported in six waves of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey of Sri Lanka during the period between 1990 and 2013, data on disaster affected population and other economic and social indicators. Employing a panel fixed effects estimator, we find that contemporaneous natural disasters and their immediate lags significantly and substantially decrease inequality in per adult equivalent household income as measured by the Theil index. Findings are robust across various inequality metrics, sub-samples and alternative estimators such as Ordinary Least Squares and System GMM. However, natural disasters do not affect household expenditure inequality. Either households behave as if they have a permanent income or all households reduce their expenditure proportionately irrespective of their income level in responding to natural disasters. Natural disasters decrease non-seasonal agricultural and non-agricultural income inequality but increase seasonal agricultural income inequality. Income of richer households is mainly derived from non-agricultural sources such as manufacturing and business activities and non-seasonal agricultural activities.

690,A new model of development coalition building: USAID achieving legitimate access and dominant information in Bangladesh’s forest policy,"['Rahman, Md Saifur', 'Miah, Sohag', 'Giessen, Lukas']","The influence of non-domestic actors and institutions on domestic policymaking process has been a constant research topic for a long time in the field of development studies. During recent years, however, the coalition strategy of foreign donors seems to have changed in favor of non-governmental allies in development cooperation, instead of state bureaucracies of the target countries. As a key foreign donor, for instance, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has introduced the forest co-management development concept, altering important policy and institutional settings in Bangladesh. The changes resulted from a combination of development inputs and politics, including funding, technical assistance and coalition with multiple, mostly non-state stakeholders. In this article, we use the concepts of development policy change, the global governance theorem of direct access to domestic policymaking process, and bureaucratic politics theory from development policy analysis for analyzing this new coalition strategy. A mixed qualitative-quantitative methods approach and the case of the USAID-induced forest co-management development model were employed to analyze the new coalition strategy based on the main interests of the donor. The results indicate that in the development process, USAID formed coalitions with non-state actors at all levels, thus circumventing national bureaucracies. The donor substantially involved non-state actors to (1) overcome the dominant information of state bureaucracies by eliciting data in the donors’ informal interests, (2) gain control over the implementation process at multiple levels, and (3) enhance pressure on all levels of government for substantive policy changes. In contrast, the initial and very marginal coalitions with state agencies imply an initial cost for legitimately accessing a country’s governance system. Furthermore, such detouring of state agencies poses the questions of operational authority and, concurrently, of ownership to sustain the changed practices. A broader implication based on the study findings is to especially consider the sovereignty issue in a development context in a recipient country.",22,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:105:y:2018:i:c:p:248-261,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.12.029,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v105y2018icp248-261.html,2020-03-09 19:49:53," 2018, Volume 105, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
691,"The prepaid electric meter: Rights, relationships and reification in Unguja, Tanzania","['Jacome, Veronica', 'Ray, Isha']","Sustainable Development Goal 7, with the light bulb and power button as its symbols, in effect promotes the universal right to basic electricity services. Access for all demands both affordability and cost-recovery, and utilities (and donors) increasingly require users to shoulder the greater burden of cost-recovery. We argue that the electricity system is underpinned by a set of relationships among user, provider and the service itself: these relationships are mediated by the meter, the technology of commodification. Using a constant-comparison approach, and based on a year of interviews and document analysis, we compare postpaid and prepaid meter regimes in Unguja, Tanzania. We ask: what difference does the mode of payment make to the (residential) user, the utility, and to the prospects for meeting SDG 7? We find that the prepaid meter becomes reified with its automated monitoring and measurement mechanism, rendering the once-familiar meter reader obsolete, and shutting off the flow of electricity as soon as the customer’s “units” have run down. Reification makes the utility more invisible to the customer, who now blames the meter rather than the utility for poor service or high bills. Our interviews reveal broad support for the prepaid meter, however, because economically vulnerable users expressed greater fear of debt than of the dark, and were willing to cede control of their consumption to the new meter. These findings undermine the common accusation of a “culture of nonpayment” in Africa. We also find that prepaid meters may incentivize the partial return to biomass-based fuels when cash is not available – exactly the behavior that universal access to electricity is supposed to prevent. We conclude that, if access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa becomes entirely contingent on payment prior to use, this is not fully compatible with a commitment to universal basic access.",24,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:105:y:2018:i:c:p:262-272,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.01.007,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v105y2018icp262-272.html,2020-03-09 19:49:57," 2018, Volume 105, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

We show how this space expands and contracts over time through “cumulative causation”. Such a dynamic framework allows us to appreciate the role of secondary towns in rural-urban migration and poverty reduction. Secondary towns occupy a unique middle ground between semi-subsistence agriculture and the capitalistic city; between what is close-by and familiar and what is much further away and unknown. By opening up the horizons of the (poorer) rural population and facilitating navigation of the non-farm economy, secondary towns allow a broader base of the poor population to become physically, economically and socially mobile. Secondary towns therefore have great potential as vehicles for inclusive growth and poverty reduction in urbanizing developing countries.

As a rare but important exception, Ethiopia’s agriculture sector recorded remarkable rapid growth during 2004–14. This paper explores this rapid change in the agriculture sector of this important country – the second most populous in Africa. We review the evidence on agricultural growth and decompose the contributions of modern inputs to growth using an adjusted Solow decomposition model. We also highlight the key pathways Ethiopia followed to achieve its agricultural growth. We find that land and labor use expanded significantly and total factor productivity grew by about 2.3% per year over the study period. Moreover, modern input use more than doubled, explaining some of this growth. The expansion in modern input use appears to have been driven by high government expenditures on the agriculture sector, including agricultural extension, but also by an improved road network, higher rural education levels, and favorable international and local price incentives.",56,4,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:105:y:2018:i:c:p:286-298,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.05.041,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v105y2018icp286-298.html,2020-03-09 19:50:04," 2018, Volume 105, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Applying a moment-based approach and a Mundlak-Chamberlain IV fixed effects model to control for unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity, the paper uses a translog production function to estimate the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of production. These estimated moments of production are then included in a multivariate adoption model to assess their effects on input adoption decisions. Results reveal that the first four moments of production significantly explain changes in the probability of adopting chemical fertilizer, improved seeds, and pesticides. While the use of these modern inputs is found to be risk decreasing, estimates suggest that the higher their purchasing costs, the greater the cost of farmers’ private risk bearing. Under the assumption of a moderate risk aversion, the risk premium amounts to 8.7% and 13.7% of the expected production revenues in Tanzania and Uganda, respectively. This willingness-to-pay is largely explained by production volatility and downside risk aversion and to a small extent by kurtosis aversion.

695,Intensification and intrahousehold decisions: Fertilizer adoption in Burkina Faso,"['Haider, Hamza', 'Smale, Melinda', 'Theriault, Veronique']","In most West African countries, agricultural production is a complex process that involves multiple household members managing land and sharing agricultural inputs. We develop an intrahousehold decision-making model to illustrate how technology adoption can influence bargaining processes on farms in harsh agricultural environments of West Africa, where staple food production by extended families is organized collectively under the leadership of a senior head. The head, who assumes primary responsibility for household food security, also allocates fields to members who manage production individually. Drawing on this and the intrinsic complementarity of labor and fertilizer as divisible inputs, we test the nature of the linkage between fertilizer use on collective and individual plots by applying bivariate probit and tobit models to nationally-representative, panel data from Burkina Faso. We find evidence of input sharing, though bargaining is inadequate to sustain efficient allocation of fertilizer. Plot manager characteristics that influence bargaining power, such as literacy, gender, age, contact with extension, and membership in farmer organizations differ between collectively- and individually-managed plots—confirming the differential status of household members in technology adoption. Agroforestry practices are strongly and positively associated with fertilizer use, regardless of plot manage type. Programs aimed at increasing use of modern agricultural inputs should consider impacts on bargaining positions within the household. Providing inputs to women and young men will increase their influence on other decisions, which may lead to greater equity within the household. It may also enhance efficiency in production, since currently, inputs are not allocated efficiently within the household.",33,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:105:y:2018:i:c:p:310-320,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.11.012,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v105y2018icp310-320.html,2020-03-09 19:50:12," 2018, Volume 105, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

To be specific, we use a “random matching within sample” technique to collect data on social networks and to elicit details of the relationships and information exchange between network members. We find that shared kinship or membership in certain groups, informal forms of mutual insurance, and having frequent meetings with network members are all associated with a higher probability of forming an information link with a network member. Furthermore, we find evidence for a statistically significant and positive relationship between networks and the adoption of row-planting as well as yields for both male and female networks. However, the evidence for an inverse U-shaped relationship of social learning, that is, between the number of adopters in the network and the adoption of row-planting, is strongest for female networks.

697,Is farmer-to-farmer extension effective? The impact of training on technology adoption and rice farming productivity in Tanzania,"['Nakano, Yuko', 'Tsusaka, Takuji W.', 'Aida, Takeshi', 'Pede, Valerien O.']","Agricultural training is a potentially effective method to diffuse relevant new technologies to increase productivity and alleviate rural poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, since it is prohibitively expensive to provide direct training to all the farmers in SSA, it is critically important to examine the extent to which technologies taught to a small number of farmers disseminate to non-trained farmers. This paper investigates the technology dissemination pathways among smallholder rice producers within a rural irrigation scheme in Tanzania. As an innovative feature, we compare the performance of three categories of farmers: key farmers, who receive intensive pre-season training at a local training center; intermediate farmers, who are trained by the key farmers; and other ordinary farmers. By collecting and analyzing a unique five-year household-level panel data set, we estimate difference-in-differences models to assess how the gap in performance evolve as the technologies spill over from the trained farmers to the ordinary farmers. To disentangle the technology spillover process, we also examine the extent to which social and geographical network with the key and intermediate farmers influences the adoption of technologies by the ordinary farmers, by incorporating social relationship variables into spatial econometric models. We found that the ordinary farmers who were a relative or residential neighbor of a key or intermediate farmer were more likely to adopt new technologies than those who were not. As a result, while the key farmers’ technology adoption rates rose immediately after the training, those of the non-trained ordinary farmers caught up belatedly.

698,"Breaking Ground: Unearthing the Potential of High-resolution, Remote-sensing Soil Data in Understanding Agricultural Profits and Technology Use in Sub-Saharan Africa","['Bhargava, Anil K.', 'Vagen, Tor', 'Gassner, Anja']","There is a growing interest in how land degradation affects the welfare of the rural poor, especially where environmental conditions continue to worsen and the future of ecosystem health remains uncertain. Nowhere is this more important than in sub-Saharan Africa, where rural poverty remains high and pressure on natural resources continues to build. At the same time, generating more agricultural profits on this land remains crucial to reducing poverty. This research asks how changing land quality, as measured by soil organic carbon (SOC) content, affects agricultural profitability and agricultural technology adoption for poor farmers in Tanzania. It is the first to match high-resolution, remote-sensing soil data to nationally representative household-plot surveys, using the World Bank’s Living Standards Measurement Study and World Agroforestry Centre’s Land Degradation Surveillance Framework. We employ a household fixed effects model that isolates SOC contributions to plot-level agricultural profits, finding positive changes of $7–8 per acre per year for each gram per kilogram change in SOC, with higher sensitivity to SOC differences for farmers with worse quality land. SOC and fertilizer use also exhibit a positive synergistic interaction with plot-level agricultural profits. Despite this, however, we find that SOC levels do not factor into fertilizer adoption decisions, and land quality has a smaller role in how farmers assign value to their land compared to how it contributes to profits. Partly because of a lack of matched, high-resolution, and nationally representative environmental and socioeconomic data, researchers and policymakers typically have not been able to include land quality as a primary dimension on which to analyze agricultural profitability and technology use in sub-Saharan Africa. We conclude that this should be a major factor in both targeting rural development and environmental policies and understanding impacts of long-run land health declines on the world’s poor.",13,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:105:y:2018:i:c:p:352-366,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.07.015,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v105y2018icp352-366.html,2020-03-09 19:50:23," 2018, Volume 105, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
699,Empirical assessment of subjective and objective soil fertility metrics in east Africa: Implications for researchers and policy makers,"['Berazneva, Julia', 'McBride, Linden', 'Sheahan, Megan', 'Güereña, David']","Bringing together emerging lessons from biophysical and social sciences as well as newly available data, we take stock of what can be learned about the relationship among subjective (reported) and objective (measured) soil fertility and farmer input use in east Africa. We identify the correlates of Kenyan and Tanzanian maize farmers’ reported perceptions of soil fertility and assess the extent to which these subjective assessments reflect measured soil chemistry. Our results offer evidence that farmers base their perceptions of soil quality and soil type on crop yields. We also find that, in Kenya, farmers’ reported soil type is a reasonable predictor of several objective soil fertility indicators while farmer-reported soil quality is not. In addition, in exploring the extent to which publicly available soil data are adequate to capture local soil chemistry realities, we find that the time-consuming exercise of collecting detailed objective measures of soil content is justified when biophysical analysis is warranted, because farmers' perceptions are not sufficiently strong proxies of these measures to be a reliable substitute and because currently available high-resolution geo-spatial data do not sufficiently capture local variation. In the estimation of agricultural production or profit functions, where the focus is on averages and in areas with low variability in soil properties, the addition of soil information does not considerably change the estimation results. However, having objective (measured) plot-level soil information improves the overall fit of the model and the estimation of marginal physical products of inputs.

However, empirical evidence on how urbanization affects these farmers is scarce. To fill this gap, this paper explores the relationship between proximity to a city and the production behavior of rural staple crop producers. More in particular, we analyze data from teff producing farmers in major producing areas around Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. We find that farmers more closely located to Addis Ababa face higher wages, land rental rates, and teff prices, leading to better incentives to intensify production as seen in the uptake of modern inputs. Moreover, we observe that land and labor productivity as well as profitability in teff production improve with urban proximity. Our results suggest that better connectivity of rural farmers to cities and growing urban demand for food are important associates of the process of agricultural intensification and transformation in Ethiopia.",66,10,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:105:y:2018:i:c:p:383-399,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.10.032,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v105y2018icp383-399.html,2020-03-09 19:50:30," 2018, Volume 105, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Roughly 80 percent of this productivity growth is accounted for by structural change as employment shares in agriculture declined while employment shares in services and manufacturing rose. Although employment in the formal sector has increased, the bulk of employment growth is accounted for by firms in the informal sector; these informal firms contributed more than one percentage point to economywide labor productivity growth. However, 94% of this labor productivity growth came from a very small subset of informal firms that belong to the in-between sector – a term meant to capture the idea that some of the firms in the informal sector share characteristics with firms in formal sector.

This study shows that the labor productivity gap between farm and non-farm sectors attenuates after controlling for labor intensity. Within agriculture, there are no productivity gaps between staple and high value crops. This provides some evidence of underemployment in agriculture and employment gaps between the farm and non-farm sectors. In addition, diversification into and within farm and non-farm sectors is positively correlated with labor productivity in the specific sector. Diversification into non-farm activities may, however, reduce farm labor productivity and requires policies that reduce such tradeoffs in the transformation process. In addition, the pathways linking income diversification and labor productivity are complex and non-linear. In Uganda, income diversification is higher among resource-poor households (with limited family labor, land, and livestock) in rural areas away from main roads or urban centers. In Nigeria, diversification is higher for male-headed households with productive assets (family labor and land) and in areas closer to markets and urban centers.",17,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:105:y:2018:i:c:p:416-427,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.12.026,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v105y2018icp416-427.html,2020-03-09 19:50:38," 2018, Volume 105, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

This raises the question of whether promoting the non-farm sector is detrimental to the performance of the farm sector. Unfortunately, the evidence base in West Africa and the Sahel for this important policy question is thin. In this paper we identify the covariates of the farm households’ decision to participate in off-farm self-employment in rural Niger. We estimate the effect of that decision on farm activity investment. We find that participating in off-farm self-employment is highly correlated with farm and non-farm factors. Participation in off-farm self-employment is linked to increased agricultural spending on crop and livestock inputs, but a lower propensity to hire labour.

In this literature-based paper, we illustrate how such an interpretation of access limits the ability of development efforts in the sector to (i) address power inequities mediating access to water services, and; (ii) acknowledge and strengthen wellbeing factors implicated with water services beyond basic health. We argue that maintaining the current interpretation of access limits the ability of development initiatives in the water sector to address pressing issues mediating people's ability to benefit from water services. To address these limitations, we propose a reinterpretation of the goal of securing access in international development frameworks grounded in Ribot and Peluso's (2003) theory of access and Amartya Sen’s (1999, 2008, 2013) Capability Approach to human development.

This study investigates the extent to which Ostrom’s Design Principles (DPs) are followed and matter for the early performance of youth groups in terms of their stability, trust and overall performance. Data from a census of 742 youth groups in five districts in Tigray in northern Ethiopia is used. This study utilizes econometric methods to assess correlations between the DPs and a range of early performance indicators. The study contributes to the limited literature on local collective action utilizing large samples. We find a high degree of compliance with the DPs. Some of the DPs appeared more important for early performance of the youth groups.

706,Buying stability: The distributive outcomes of private politics in the Bolivian mining industry,"['Amengual, Matthew']","Social movements and interest groups in developing countries increasingly challenge large firms to influence their behavior and make direct claims for redistribution of the gains from economic activity. In response to such private politics, firms seek to maintain political support in the localities in which they operate so that they can avoid conflict and secure access to resources. To secure local support and defuse opposition, some firms take actions that expand access to essential public goods, services, and economic opportunities, while others use targeted clientelistic benefits that reward only a few. What accounts for this variation? Answering this question is key to identifying the development consequences of private politics. This article explores this question through a study of multinational mining firms operating in Bolivia, drawing on qualitative data from interviews as well as an original household survey. It shows that the political structures and organization in the localities in which firms operate create distinct incentives for firms to distribute benefits in targeted or inclusive ways.

How do they distribute this aid? While donors agreed to prioritise “particularly vulnerable” countries, we know from the general aid allocation literature that donors (also) use aid as a foreign policy tool to promote their own economic and political goals. In this paper, we analyse data on bilateral adaptation aid from 2010 through 2015 to assess to what extent adaptation aid is provided in response to recipient need (that is, vulnerability to climate change impacts) as opposed to recipient merit (that is, good governance) and donors’ interests. In contrast to previous research, we find that donors partly take into account vulnerability to climate change. Countries that are physically more exposed to climate change tend to be more likely to receive some adaptation aid and also receive more adaptation aid per capita, as do poorer countries, small island developing states and—to a lesser extent—least developed countries. Countries with lower adaptive capacity, however, do not receive more adaptation aid; instead, donors reward well-governed countries with adaptation aid as well as use adaptation aid to promote their own economic interests.

Measuring resilience capacity and how it varies over time is extremely significant for policy makers and people living in risk-prone environments. More specifically, there is a gap of empirical evidence about what drives changes in resilience capacity status (i.e. moving from a low resilience profile to a high one, and viceversa). This paper applies econometric techniques for estimating household resilience and adopts transition matrices to estimate how it changes over time. Finally, multinomial logit and bivariate probit models are estimated to identify the main drivers of change. Our study finds that female headed households are less likely to become the most resilient; also this paper demonstrates that education and participation to household enterprises are positively associated with increased resilience capacity. This paper innovates the resilience literature by providing an evidence based analysis of the main drivers of resilience; it brings this evidence in the Uganda’s context, focusing the attention of the policy makers on sub-sample of population which are worse off.

The architects of the HIPC initiative and MDRI posited that these programs would spur growth and investment. This paper exploits the variability of participation in the HIPC initiative and MDRI across time and country, in order to identity the effect of participation on growth and investment. I find that the decision point and post-completion point periods of the enhanced HIPC initiative are associated with a 1.762 percentage point and 3.139 percentage point increase in public investment, respectively. The impact is higher in countries with low access to international capital markets. The enhanced HIPC initiative increases private investment by 1.838 percentage points during the post-completion point period in countries with low access to international capital, for approximately two years, but has no effect on growth or foreign direct investment. I find no effect of the original HIPC initiative or MDRI on growth, private investment, public investment or foreign direct investment. I find no heterogeneous impact of the enhanced HIPC initiative on growth and foreign direct investment by level of indebtedness, access to international capital markets, or institutional quality. As the measures of institutional quality have barely changed between 1996 and 2014 in HIPC countries, the results of this paper suggest that without a strong improvement in institutional quality, debt relief is unlikely to boost investment and growth in Africa. Possible future debt relief in SSA countries should be associated with a component directly aimed at improving institutional quality.

India, where de facto responsibility for the power sector rests with subnational (state) governments, provides a useful laboratory to examine why. The state of West Bengal provides an example of public sector reform as an alternative to the so-called “World Bank template” for electricity liberalization, and a lens on the political preconditions for reform success. Drawing on 30 elite interviews in 2016 alongside comparative evidence from other Indian states, this article documents the reform design and assesses its success. West Bengal’s reforms aimed at internally strengthening the utility against political interference. The study finds that this reform model delivered initial performance among the best of any Indian utility, and that successful reforms in several other states were also more statist than often recognized. However, longer-term sustainability remains challenging. While weak rural lobbies had some effect, the study explains this trajectory as the result of the transition from one-party dominance to intensified party-political competition, a finding that resonates with evidence from other Indian states. In contrast to influential political theories developed in the Global North, this suggests that party-political competition does not make Indian politicians more likely to deliver public services, but rather leads to short-termism and political capture of utilities. Conversely, under some conditions one-party dominance can encourage longer-term reforms.

This debate is still crucial for present day Egypt, a country facing major challenges, including food security, agriculture modernization, employment generation, and land fragmentation due to dramatic population growth. In this context, policy makers are always seeking the best land allocation system for these new lands. This paper analyzes the land tenure and land use dynamics of farmers’ settlements during a program of land reclamation (from 1960 to 2010) in the Western Desert of the Nile Delta. The objective is to describe the land development paths of farm settlement and to identify promising dynamics by cross-referencing the farmers’ stories and their livelihood achievements. To accomplish that, we conducted household surveys and interviews to learn the life stories’ of 175 family farms. Our study finds that, beyond the rules and institutions that fixed the land tenure regimes and its distribution in these new lands, settlers have found different ways to hold on and secure their land farm, even if the unequal land distribution still structure the population. The results highlight also the dynamism of small-scale settlers, regarding livelihood diversification, to face the challenges of these desert environments. In addition, the dual-purpose system embedded in mixed crop-livestock systems can contribute to settlers’ livelihood security. These realities confound the unchanged rhetoric of government and this calls for more social consideration of these new rural spaces based on a combination of heterogeneous networks off relationships and knowledge.

714,Does social identity matter in individual alienation? Household-level evidence in post-reform India,"['Gupta, Prashant', 'Mallick, Sushanta', 'Mishra, Tapas']","Does consumption distance as a measure of individual alienation reveal the effect of social identity? Using the central idea of Akerlof’s ‘social distance’ theory, individual distance is calculated from their own group mean consumption and then we examine whether individuals from different social groups – caste and religion – are alienated across the distance distribution. Using India’s household-level microdata on consumption expenditure covering three major survey rounds since the inception of the reform period, we find a non-unique pattern where the marginalised and minority group households tend to be alienated across the distance distribution. However, among them, the households with higher educational attainment become more integrated as reflected in the interaction effect of education. These results are robust even after controlling for the endogeneity of education. Given this significant group difference in consumption, we undertake a group-level comparison by creating a counterfactual group through exchanging the characteristics of the privileged group to the marginalised group (or Hindus to non-Hindus), and find that the privileged group still consumes more than the counterfactual marginalised group, explaining around 77% of the estimated average consumption gap at the median quantile in 2011–12 (or 59% for Hindus versus Non-Hindus). This suggests other inherent identity-specific social factors as possible contributors to within-group alienation (relative to a better-off category) that can only be minimised through promoting education for the marginalised (or minority religion) group.",37,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:104:y:2018:i:c:p:154-172,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.11.007,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v104y2018icp154-172.html,2020-03-09 19:51:22," 2018, Volume 104, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
715,Collective demands and secret codes: The multiple uses of “community” in “community mobilization”,"['Vijayakumar, Gowri']","The romance of “community mobilization” continues to pervade development and public health programs. Critics argue that “community” has become a buzzword devoid of content or a mechanism of neoliberal governmentality. This article revisits these approaches to community mobilization, using ethnographic data from a context in which “community mobilization” has met with wide acclaim: HIV prevention programs in India. Focusing on how the concept of community is used in everyday practice reveals its multivalence and flexibility. I show that, for many planners and administrators of HIV prevention programs, “community mobilization” is a strategy for placing responsibility for HIV prevention onto groups at risk, but, for those groups, it also has two alternative usages: as the basis for making collective demands, and as a code word for membership in a subversive sexual category. These latter two uses undergird the formation of “communities” that make new demands on the state. While scholars tend to characterize community mobilization programs in terms of their intent, as either mostly empowering or mostly a mechanism of domination, this article shifts the focus to how the concept of community is used, demonstrating its multiple usages within the same program. I show that groups bring to bear on the concept of “community” not only abstracted NGO concepts, but also a history of using “community” in India as a political category of membership. Rather than rejecting or celebrating the concept of “community”, this article uses ethnography to show how community is put to use and given meaning through everyday struggles for control and survival.",13,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:104:y:2018:i:c:p:173-182,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.11.009,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v104y2018icp173-182.html,2020-03-09 19:51:26," 2018, Volume 104, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Since the development literature has firmly established the role of weather risk as a source of income volatility for the poor, and climate change is expected to increase this risk, we review the range of risk-coping mechanisms available to poorer households, with a focus on possible barriers to adaptation. We ask both how government interventions affect the set of options available for adaptation and risk coping, and also what these adaptive responses imply for the prospects of sustainable development. Support for adaptation can involve efforts to make existing locations, livelihoods and forms of production more resilient to climate risk (in-situ adaptation), or reductions in vulnerability through the geographical and sectoral mobility of the poor (transformational adaptation). Our review shows how successful adaptation will need to strike a balance between the two forms of adaptation, avoiding locking-in unsustainable practices in locations that are already marginal from an economic perspective, and taking account of broader socio-economic trends already taking place in many developing countries (such as population growth and urbanisation). We also highlight important considerations for policy-makers, which to date have been relatively neglected in the literature, in particular related to the dynamic interaction between adaptation and sustainable development.",62,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:104:y:2018:i:c:p:183-196,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.11.016,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v104y2018icp183-196.html,2020-03-09 19:51:30," 2018, Volume 104, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

The main question is whether the gains from investments in ICT differ between developing, emerging and developed countries. The analysis is based on a high-quality sample of 59 countries for the period 1995–2010. Various panel data regressions confirm the previously reported positive relationship between ICT capital and GDP growth. For the combined sample of all 59 countries, the estimated output elasticity of ICT is larger than the ICT factor compensation share suggesting excess returns to ICT capital. The regressions for the subsamples of developing, emerging and developed countries do not reveal statistically significant differences in the output elasticity of ICT between these three groups of countries. Thus, the results indicate that developing and emerging countries are not gaining more from investments in ICT than developed economies, calling into question the argument that these countries are ‘leapfrogging’ through ICT.",52,16,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:104:y:2018:i:c:p:197-211,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.11.024,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v104y2018icp197-211.html,2020-03-09 19:51:33," 2018, Volume 104, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

The Human Rights Commission and later Council (UNHRCC) are internationally legitimized tools where member states shame repressive regimes for human rights violations in public resolutions. We argue that these resolutions can influence foreign investors in two main ways: (1) They signal that a state is an outcast, unable to secure alliances within the UN human rights bodies that protect it from being publicly shamed, with negative consequences for investment attractiveness (‘outcast’ effect). (2) They signal that a state is one of the most rogue, severe human rights violators because voting members of the UNHRCC may be aware of many human rights violations, but they pass resolutions only in the harshest cases (‘bottleneck’ effect). Any MNC associated with such a country risks severe reputational damage. Results from a panel data analysis of 165 countries (1977–2013) confirm that UNHRCC condemnations deter FDI. This effect is amplified by media reporting of human rights abuse, and stronger and more robust than a bad human rights record of a state itself. NGO shaming and milder UNHRCC sanctions (which do not reach resolution stage) have less strong effects, although the result on NGO shaming is to be seen with caution due to a reduced sample size.",27,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:104:y:2018:i:c:p:222-237,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.11.014,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v104y2018icp222-237.html,2020-03-09 19:51:41," 2018, Volume 104, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Our analysis investigates whether saving promotion can effectively increase savings, consumption, and future-oriented investments in Sub-Saharan Africa. In an extensive search of 28 academic and policy-focused databases in the fields of economics, psychology, and social sciences, 9330 titles and abstracts of published and unpublished studies were screened and 27 randomized controlled trials on saving promotion interventions fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 24 studies reporting on an aggregated sample of 87,025 individuals provided sufficient information to be included in the meta-analysis. Robust-variance estimations of pooled effect sizes show small but significant impacts on poverty reduction, including increases in household expenditures and incomes, higher returns from family businesses, and improved food security. They also show positive and significant impacts on more intermediate outcomes including total savings, pro-saving attitudes, financial literacy, and investments in small-scale family businesses. Our results do not show significant effects on assets, housing quality, education, or health. Results from meta-regressions suggest that supply-based programs are superior to demand-enhancing program types such as financial education. They further reveal reduced program effectiveness for women.

However, there is less empirical research on how domestic violence impacts nutrition and food security. Two pathways described in the literature are (1) perpetrators withhold food as a form violence or control, leading to poor nutrition of women and (2) women’s food preparation and portion allocation trigger “retaliatory” violence by perpetrators. Interviews by community researchers with over 100 women in rural Bangladesh reveal a little documented linkage between violence and food practices in rural Bangladesh. I find that women, in light of the realities and possibilities of domestic violence, weigh choices about food consumption and distribution, often choosing to eat less or lower quality foods. That is, women often demonstrate agentic decision-making in a context of violence, referred to here as “burdened agency.” Women traverse and navigate a complex set of relationships between hunger, undernutrition, agency and domestic violence, differing from the two presumed-causal pathways. Recognizing burdened agency can explain how women make decisions around food practices, and why the uptake of certain food security and nutrition interventions may be reduced.",10,4,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:104:y:2018:i:c:p:271-280,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.11.019,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v104y2018icp271-280.html,2020-03-09 19:51:52," 2018, Volume 104, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Covering some 1.35 million hectares or about 25% of the country’s arable area, agricultural estates are an important part of Malawi’s rural economy. However, the analysis shows that 70% of these estates have expired leases, reducing government revenue from ground rent by up to US$35 million or 5% of the total public spending annually. The low quality of spatial records, as indicated by the fact that some 140,000 hectares under estates are subject to overlapping claims could preclude the land market participation, especially under longer-term contracts. Data from a 2006/07 survey suggest that estates’ yield, productivity, and intensity of land use are below those of small farms. While the recently passed land laws create a basis for low-cost systematic demarcation and registration of rights to customary land, our analysis suggests that, to maximize their likely contribution to increasing productivity and welfare rather than conflict, such efforts need to be preceded by a clarification of boundaries and lease status of existing estates and ideally a more detailed study of the reasons underpinning the low productivity.",43,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:104:y:2018:i:c:p:281-296,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.11.025,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v104y2018icp281-296.html,2020-03-09 19:51:56," 2018, Volume 104, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Using panel data from Indonesia we find that more than half of working age adults in our sample experience a physical disability at least once in four waves over 16 years. Changes in physical functioning have no effect on hours worked among the employed. However, onsets of physical limitations lead to an increase in the probability of leaving employment, while recoveries increase the probability of returning to work. A larger effect is found among self-employed workers compared to salaried workers. Given the rising prevalence of physical limitations with age, physical disability may be a significant barrier to employment for older working age adults in Indonesia.

These expectations might then in turn shape individuals’ investment behaviors, potentially affecting their incomes in subsequent years. As part of an emerging literature on endogenous preferences, economists have begun studying the consequences that exposure to natural disasters have on risk attitudes, perceptions, and behavior. We add to this field by studying the impact of being struck by the December 2012 Cyclone Evan on Fijian households’ risk attitudes and subjective expectations about the likelihood and severity of natural disasters over the next 20 years. The randomness of the cyclone’s path allows us to estimate the causal effects of exposure on both risk attitudes and risk perceptions. Our results show that being struck by an extreme event substantially changes individuals’ risk perceptions as well as their beliefs about the frequency and magnitude of future shocks. However, we find sharply distinct results for the two ethnicities in our sample, indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians; the impact of the natural disaster aligns with previous results in the literature on risk attitudes and risk perceptions for Indo-Fijians, whereas they have little to no impact on those same measures for indigenous Fijians.",29,4,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:104:y:2018:i:c:p:310-325,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.12.002,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v104y2018icp310-325.html,2020-03-09 19:52:04," 2018, Volume 104, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
726,It’s a boy! Women and decision-making benefits from a son in India,"['Zimmermann, Laura']","Son preference is widespread in a number of developing countries despite substantial improvements in education levels and economic development. One potential explanation for the persistence of this phenomenon is that individual household members like the mother derive large non-monetary benefits from giving birth to a son and therefore prefer boys to girls. Qualitative evidence suggests that such benefits exist and may depend on the child’s age. This paper uses large nationally representative datasets from India and tests whether having a son leads to higher decision-making powers for mothers than having a daughter. Since the number and gender composition of children is likely to be non-random for families that want a son, I focus on first-born children for whom the sex ratio of girls relative to boys is normal. The main analysis also focuses on young children of up to six months, which gives parents little time to adjust desired birth-spacing intervals that could be systematically correlated with decision-making powers and child gender. The results show little evidence of consistently large female benefits shortly after birth, and any positive impacts of having a son disappear after the first six months. There are also no large benefits for adult sons. These empirical patterns do not support qualitative evidence suggesting that women benefit from the birth of a son through larger decision-making powers in the household because of increased respect by other household members. The benefits also do not heavily depend on the child’s age, which is not consistent with a channel predicting a better bargaining position for women with adult sons who start taking over the running of the household.

In societies where the norm is to not expect future support from daughters, parents may invest even less in the health and human capital of girls. In India, as in other patriarchal societies, the eldest son occupies a special position as the potential head of the extended family and is expected to assume responsibility for parents' welfare in their old age. In this paper, I explore intra-household differences in educational expenditure and enrollment for children by gender and birth order. Using child level data from the nationally representative India Human Development Survey-II (2011–12), I confirm the presence of a pro-male bias and an additional preference for the eldest son. In families with more children and greater competition for resources within the household, the pro-male bias falls and the bias in favor of the eldest son is greater. Parents in the higher income bracket, who are also less likely to be dependent on their children, discriminate less in favor of the eldest son. As expected, pro-male bias is highest in the north, central and eastern zones of the country. The north-eastern zone exhibits the lowest levels of intra household discrimination based on gender.

It also looks at what individual and household characteristics may have moved these children into or out of situations of nutritional deprivation and how their stunting profile in later childhood correlates with psychosocial outcomes at age 19 and how it may have intergenerational consequences.

The paper finds that there are significant gender based biases in growth faltering later in childhood disfavouring girls and that becoming newly stunted as an adolescent is strongly correlated with a child reporting to have poorer relationships with peers compared to the group that were never stunted. We also find that a girl experiencing stunting in middle childhood or adolescence (even if they were not stunted at age 8 or eventually moved out of being stunted by age 19) correlates significantly with offspring being shorter and thinner than the offspring of girls never stunted.

In this context, individuals who are socially embedded and exposed to the existing biosocial arena integrate macro-institutional determinants with everyday micro-institutional settings during the life course.

It applies longitudinal methods of household survey and life course analyses of individuals reporting diseases to understand the interplay of institutions. The analysis reveals statutory rules creating boundary conditions for exposure to infection. The individuals exploit these using the socially embedded norms to contest and negotiate through coalitions and networks. The statutory rules defines the scope and outcomes of the health-seeking decisions. The study in two case study reveals that seemingly ‘planned settlement’ is conducive over the spread of infections than in slum-like settlement. It calls for strategic focus on improving the boundary conditions – the environmental hygiene and public health infrastructure – which might be more effective than contemporary neo-liberal techno-centric and individualized interventions. Failure to promote these actions will provide an environment conducive to the future spread of infectious and non-infectious diseases. Theoretically, it pushes for greater understanding of the socio-political struggle of individuals, rather than focusing on risk factors and dualistic nature of macro- and micro-institutions.

731,Disability and school attendance in 15 low- and middle-income countries,"['Mizunoya, Suguru', 'Mitra, Sophie', 'Yamasaki, Izumi']","Out of school children are a critical issue in education and development. Very little is known as to whether a disability is associated with a higher risk of being out of school for children in developing countries. This paper presents and analyzes the gap in enrolment in both primary and secondary education between children with and without disabilities using for the first time an internationally tested and comparable measure of functional difficulties (e.g. seeing, hearing, and walking). Using nationally representative datasets from 15 developing countries, this paper finds a consistent and statistically significant disability gap in both primary and secondary school attendance. The paper econometrically examines potential explanations for this disability gap using several specifications. A household fixed effect model shows that disability reduces the probability of school attendance by a median 30.9 percentage points, and that neither individual characteristics nor their socio-economic and unobserved household characteristics explain the disability gap. While general poverty reduction policies through for instance social transfers to the poor may improve school attendance in general, they seem unlikely to close the disability gap in schooling. The disability gap for primary–age children follows an inverted U-shape relationship with GNI per capita. This suggests that, as GNI per capita rises and more resources become available for improving access to education in middle-income countries, children without disabilities increasingly attend school, whereas the situation of children with disabilities may improve more slowly. Despite the adoption of an inclusive education agenda globally, this paper shows that more research and policy attention is needed to make schooling disability-inclusive in developing countries. More attention is also necessary regarding the functional difficulties experienced by children, as some may be preventable and the schooling inequalities associated with them may thus be avoidable.",20,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:104:y:2018:i:c:p:388-403,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.12.001,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v104y2018icp388-403.html,2020-03-09 19:52:26," 2018, Volume 104, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
732,Natural disasters and agricultural protection: A panel data analysis,"['Klomp, Jeroen', 'Hoogezand, Barry']","We explore the impact of natural disasters on the degree of agricultural protection using data from 76 countries thereby covering more than 70 of the most traded agricultural commodities. Theoretically, the direction of this effect is not a priori directly clear as it balances the trade-off between protecting the economic interests of the domestic agricultural sector on the one hand and ensuring food availability for the society at large on the other. Our most important findings suggest that natural disasters generally raise agricultural trade controls to favor domestic farmers. These barriers are mainly provided by limiting imports in the aftermath of a natural event. However, the protection pattern differs among countries. To be more specific, floods and storms increase agricultural protection in high-income countries, while trade barriers in many LDCs are reduced during periods of extreme drought in an attempt to diminish food scarcity. Finally, it turns out that a large part of the change in agricultural protection caused by a natural disaster is explained by a number of commodity specific particularities (i.e., food vs. cash crops).",46,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:104:y:2018:i:c:p:404-417,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.11.013,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v104y2018icp404-417.html,2020-03-09 19:52:30," 2018, Volume 104, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Evidence from India on Affirmative Action And Everyday Discrimination,"['Girard, Victoire']","This article investigates whether affirmative action, in the form of electoral quotas, affects group-based discrimination. The redistributive effect of quotas is subject to debate, and their ultimate target is discrimination. To identify the effect of electoral quotas, I take advantage of their rotation across space and over time in India. To proxy discrimination, I use a measure of caste-based exclusion from a public infrastructure (namely, streets). In 2006, 44.5% household members of the marginalized castes labeled Scheduled Castes (SC) still suffered from caste-based exclusions. I document that ongoing SC quotas reduce the likelihood of caste-based exclusion for members of the SCs by about one fifth. The results also imply that the effect is not persistent: it disappears with the end of the SC quota. From a policy-maker’s perspective, these results are mixed since electoral quotas do affect everyday discrimination, even if the effect does not last. These results are consistent with a temporary change in the behavior of members of the dominant castes after a one-shot electoral quota. These results are inconsistent with either a change in the stereotypes held by members of the dominant castes, or a change in the aspirations of members of the lower castes.",45,6,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:103:y:2018:i:c:p:1-13,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.10.008,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v103y2018icp1-13.html,2020-03-09 19:52:33," 2018, Volume 103, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

The strong linkages to food security and the environment place biomass energy at the heart of sustainable development, a fact that is largely ignored by policy makers in favor of modern energy. At the same time, population and GDP growth are exacerbating already existing supply–demand imbalances in highly populated countries such as Malawi. These trends make it imperative to identify policy interventions that promote sustainable biomass energy while simultaneously considering linkages with other sectors. We use new data on demand and supply for biomass energy in Malawi and develop a model that estimates fuelwood demand based on actual diets and project demand in future years. We simulate how demand side interventions in the form of improved cookstoves affect biomass demand and built a behavioral model to analyze the potential of agroforestry for promoting a sustainable biomass energy sector in Malawi. Our findings show that policy measures aimed at increasing cooking efficiency are not enough to decrease demand for cooking energy due to high population growth. Supply side interventions like agroforestry on the other hand will not only increase sustainable supply, but can also enhance food security and protect the environment. We find that biomass energy can be inherently sustainable and should be an integral part of every energy sector strategy in developing countries as well as of the Sustainable Development Goals.",14,4,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:103:y:2018:i:c:p:14-26,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.10.011,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v103y2018icp14-26.html,2020-03-09 19:52:37," 2018, Volume 103, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Due to climate change, the number of people affected by natural disasters is increasing every year with a marked debilitating effect on developing countries as compared to developed countries. To tackle these challenges, the United Nations “Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–30” identified “seven global targets”, of which the first target is to “substantially reduce global disaster mortality by 2030”. This research contributes to this emerging domain of knowledge by bringing gender disaggregated mortality data from 1999 to 2013 from an Indian state called Odisha. In doing so, this research brings three questions to the fore: first, why do deaths occur in disasters? This is answered by going beyond the traditional perspectives on risk and vulnerability to include a “complex perspective” developed from the theories of organization, violence, and justice. Second, who is responsible to reduce deaths and third, how deaths get recorded and reported? Based on a review of annual death reports, census data, and seven expert interviews, findings suggest that the current disaster management system in Odisha is not accountable and the death reporting and recording system merits change in order to be consistent with the Sendai’s Goal to reduce deaths. This study posits that complex perspective has the potential to improve disaster management system by shifting the attention from “at risk” community to the actors and organizations’ and to the necessary resources and measures that will be required to reduce deaths in resource poor contexts.",4,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:103:y:2018:i:c:p:27-39,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.10.003,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v103y2018icp27-39.html,2020-03-09 19:52:41," 2018, Volume 103, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

However, less advancement has been observed in the use of self-reported data to capture the short-run disaster–development nexus in least developed countries’ with high climatic risks. This self-identification in the questionnaire could be advantageous to capture the disaster impacts on households more precisely when compared to index-based identifications based on geographical exposure. In this paper, we ask: “what are the impacts on household income, expenditure, asset, and labor market outcomes of recurrent flooding in Bangladesh?” We examine the short-run economic impacts of recurrent flooding on Bangladeshi households surveyed in year 2010. In 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), households answered a set of questions on whether they were affected by flood and its likely impacts. We identify treatment (affected) groups using two measures of disaster risk exposure; the self-reported flood hazard data, and historical rainfall data-based flood risk index. The paper directly compares the impacts of climatic disaster (i.e., recurrent flooding) on economic development. We further examine these impacts by pooling the data for the years’ 2000, 2005, and 2010 and compare the results with our benchmark estimations.

Through a comprehensive search and screening process, we identify a total of 19 cross-country econometric studies containing 169 estimates of this relationship. We find that the size and direction of the estimated relationship are affected by a range of factors, most notably the composition of the sample used for estimation, the control variables included in the regression model, and the type of government spending. Overall, we find no clear evidence that higher government spending has played a significant role in reducing income poverty in low- and middle-income countries. This is consistent with the view that fiscal policy plays a much more limited redistributive role in developing countries, in comparison with OECD countries. In addition, we find that the relationship between government spending and poverty is on average less negative for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and more negative for countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, compared to other regions.

We address potential endogeneity and econometric drawbacks by means of the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood estimation methods. The results indicate that both the institutional conditions at destination and the institutional distance between exporting and importing countries are relevant factors for bilateral trade.

The link between better health and better economic performance is by now well established, and many vaccines have been shown to generate significant ROI in a classical cost-benefit framework. To our knowledge, the longer term macroeconomic benefits of improved vaccination programs have not been estimated. We modify the standard conditional convergence model to account for changes in vaccination rates across time and countries, and use the modified model to estimate the macroeconomic gains from improved vaccination rates, using the DTP vaccine as a proxy for vaccination programs generally. We find evidence to suggest economically and statistically significant and sustained increases in the GDP growth rate associated with lagged increases in vaccination rates; furthermore, we find these effects increasing over time. We find that investments of the sort made by the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunization (Gavi) are linked to measurably higher DTP rates, and we estimate the returns to such investments as at least 12:1.

We examine its effect on labor market responses, marital dissolution, and the decision-making process regarding the use of money. The assignment mechanism to the AFAM-PE exogenously alters the distribution of non-labor income across applicant households by targeting the monetary transfer (usually) to the female spouse. Our identification strategy exploits both the female targeting and a discontinuity in eligibility for enrollment into the program. Based on a regression discontinuity design and on a follow-up survey matched with program’s administrative records, this study finds that the program has significant negative effects on the formality choice of women at the eligibility cut-off. These responses seem to be associated with a lower rate of moving from unregistered jobs to formality. We also find suggestive evidence that the program results in women taking greater (perceived) responsibility for decisions in specific spheres of household expenditures. This study, represents one of the first efforts to analyze the distributional effects of CCT programs on different couples members’ behavioral responses.

We show that despite widespread land use changes in the area and the emergence of private enclosures on communal grazing lands, disputes around administrative borders trump all other determinants of conflict. We also find significant spatial and scale differences in the incidence of conflict, and that different types of conflict are taken to different conflict resolution institutions. Along these lines we also demonstrate that overall conflict and dissatisfaction with conflict resolution outcomes are more pronounced among the more mobile, livestock-dependent segment of the population than other groups.

743,The politics of local government performance: Elite cohesion and cross-village constraints in decentralized Senegal,"['Wilfahrt, Martha']","The adoption of democratic decentralization across the developing world has been critiqued by scholars and practitioners for both macro-level institutional shortcomings and, on a more micro scale, for falling prey to elite capture. This article draws on interviews with over 350 local authorities in decentralized Senegal to call attention to a third level of analysis: the meso-level of the local state itself. Though local elites dominate positions of authority everywhere, the article argues that local government performance varies subnationally as a function of elites’ relations among each other across villages. Where denser cross-village social ties generate higher cohesion among elites, individual opportunism is constrained and local government performance improves. Where such cross-village relations are weaker, elites see local institutions as a zero-sum game among villages. The composition of local social relations, in other words, drives better or worse governance at the local level. Because West African cross-village relations are largely determined by historical settlement patterns, notably the presence or absence of a precolonial state, the article suggests that local political strategies are historically constrained. The link between history and local government performance documented here holds important implications for the nature of political representation and local development outcomes following the recent wave of democratic decentralization in sub-Saharan Africa.",19,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:103:y:2018:i:c:p:149-161,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.09.010,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v103y2018icp149-161.html,2020-03-09 19:53:10," 2018, Volume 103, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
744,Procedural Justice in Value Chains Through Public–private Partnerships,"['Thorpe, Jodie']","This paper is about making agricultural value chains work for smallholder farmers, and the way that governments can achieve this aim through public–private partnerships (PPPs). Applied to agricultural value chains, PPPs seek to catalyze new investments, support chain upgrading, or improve the performance of poorly functioning chains through joint activities that capitalize on the complementary resources and competencies of public and private partners. Smallholder farmers are frequently the intended beneficiaries. However, there is little understanding of how the terms of value chain participation affect farmer perceptions of and behavior within chains, or the role of the public sector in influencing these arrangements. This paper analyzes in-depth case studies from Ghana, Indonesia, Rwanda, and Uganda to better understand a surprising empirical finding: that farmers that experience strong PPP results in terms of productivity and incomes may nevertheless remain dissatisfied, while those experiencing much more modest gains can view the PPP favorably. At the heart is an analytical framework based on five attributes of “procedural justice”. It finds that public sector actors, through PPPs, are able to shape governance within value chains, influencing the relative skills, knowledge, and resources which different actors possess, the way that farmers are organized to engage in the value chain, and the attributes of procedural justice reflected in chain arrangements. Where procedural justice is weak, farmers are more likely to exit or neglect the arrangements, leaving the value chain underperforming with sub-optimal outcomes for all: for farmers, for lead firms, and for government agencies.

Using original data on productive structures, growth determinants and Bolsa Familia conditional transfers (BFP) for the 184 municipalities of the Brazilian state of Ceará during 2003–10, we show that the positive impact of the transfers on local growth is in fact conditional on the direction of local economic structure transformation. Indeed, transfers did spur light manufacturing transformation activities only in the poorest and less-industrialized localities and did prompt informal activities in weakly productive services in all municipalities. Although we do not find support for the hypothesis of a redistribution trap, our estimations indicate that, on average, the growth impact of BFP transfers could have been twice as great during the period investigated in the absence of the adverse impact of social transfers on structural transformation. By promoting services and informal occupations, including in light manufacturing industries, the BFP could possibly cause a problem of job quality in the future.

On one hand, crime against women is on the rise while on the other, women’s labor force participation rate (WLFPR) has been declining over the last three decades. We estimate the extent to which the decline in WLFPR can be assigned to increasing instances of crime against women. We argue that an increase in crime against women, increases the non-pecuniary costs of traveling to work, particularly in a traditional society marked by stigma against victims of sexual crimes. Our findings suggest that women are less likely to work away from home in regions where the perceived threat of sexual harassment against girls is higher. The estimate is robust to various sensitivity checks. Moreover, the deterrence effect of crime responds to the opportunity cost of work on one hand and the stigma cost of sexual crimes on the other.",16,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:103:y:2018:i:c:p:226-238,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.10.031,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v103y2018icp226-238.html,2020-03-09 19:53:33," 2018, Volume 103, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

NREGS was rolled out across India in three distinct phases, and this phased introduction is used to identify difference-in-difference estimates of the program effect. Using monthly data on wage rates from the period 2000–2011 in 209 districts across 18 Indian states, we include district-specific fixed effects and trends to control for differences in wage rates in the absence of the program. We find that, on average, the program boosted the growth rate of real daily agricultural wages by 4.3% per year. The effect of the scheme is more consistent with an increase in the growth rate of wages than with a discontinuous jump in wages. The effect was concentrated in some states and in the agricultural peak season, appears to have been gender-neutral and was biased towards unskilled labor. Since many of the world’s poorest depend on casual agricultural labor for their livelihood, while at the same time minimum-wage legislation is unlikely to be effective in many developing countries, we argue that rural public employment programs constitute a potentially important anti-poverty policy tool.",24,13,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:103:y:2018:i:c:p:239-254,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.10.027,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v103y2018icp239-254.html,2020-03-09 19:53:36," 2018, Volume 103, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Given the persistence of rural poverty in Northeast Brazil and the existence of both land and credit market failures, land reforms remain important policy tools for alleviating poverty and increasing growth. This paper evaluates the impact of the recent National Program of Land Credit, a controversial market-assisted land reform program that provides access to land through private land markets. Household-level panel data covering similar beneficiary and control groups allows for identification using both propensity score weighting and difference-in-difference methodologies. The evidence indicates that the Land Credit successfully transitions households into agriculture, with land holdings and investments increasing as a result of the program. As with many earlier land reform programs in Latin America, the new wave of market-assisted land reforms does not increase access to private credit. While land reforms have the potential to drive redistribution, poverty reduction, and growth, these findings suggest that ensuring greater access to credit, irrigation, and higher return economic activities remains important.",37,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:103:y:2018:i:c:p:255-267,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.10.007,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v103y2018icp255-267.html,2020-03-09 19:53:40," 2018, Volume 103, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

We argue that as a consequence of the increase in state presence and visibility, municipalities with a higher level of formalization of their land property rights witnessed a greater reduction in the area allocated to illicit crops. We hypothesize that this is due to the possibility of obtaining more benefits in the newly installed institutional environment when land is formalized, and the increased cost of growing illicit crops on formal relative to informal land. We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the formality index for smallholders is related to a reduction in the share of municipal area allocated to coca crops of 0.101 percentage points. That is, the formalization of one additional hectare of land with respect to small landholders in an average municipality in the year 2000 is associated with a decrease of approximately 1.4 hectares of land allocated to coca within that particular municipality, ceteris paribus. These results remain robust to a number of sensitivity analyses.

753,Public Policy Reform and Informal Institutions: The Political Articulation of the Demand for Work in Rural India,"['Marcesse, Thibaud']","The emphasis on rights that individual citizens can claim from the state represents a significant institutional development for poverty alleviation policies. In India, important legislation was passed in 2005 to guarantee rural households 100 days of work paid at a statutory wage rate. This Right to Work legislation has enabled the implementation of the world’s largest public works program—the “Mahatma Gandhi” National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme or NREGS. This study explores variation in policy outcomes under NREGS within a rural district of North India (Uttar Pradesh). It finds that this variation is the product of the interaction between formal and informal institutions. As such, the demand for work benefits does not emerge spontaneously from self-selecting rural citizens, but is articulated by local elected officials who are pressurised to accommodate demands for rents from the bureaucracy. Specifically, local elected officials are compelled to proceed to a selective activation of the demand for benefits to ensure the generation of a surplus which will form the basis of bureaucratic rent payments. The study relies on qualitative data, specifically interviews with past beneficiaries of the scheme, bureaucrats tasked with policy implementation, and elected village leaders (the Gram Pradhans in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh) to document the conditions under which a surplus is extracted and rent payments made. The study shows that caste and political leadership structures at the local level affect the generation of surpluses and the payment of rents by Gram Pradhans to the bureaucracy. While the Right to Work legislation represents progress for poverty alleviation, policies such as NREGS that emphasize rights and the expression of a demand for benefits need to consider more carefully the conditions under which this demand emerges as well as the ways in which discretionary authority can thwart the goals of public policy.",20,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:103:y:2018:i:c:p:284-296,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.10.024,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v103y2018icp284-296.html,2020-03-09 19:53:48," 2018, Volume 103, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

This has important implications for targeting interventions and allocating resources in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Several problems affect the measurement of urban poverty: definitions of ‘slum’ settlements vary widely, data collection may undercount slum populations, insufficient data disaggregation may conceal intra-city disparities, and common indicators and assumptions may be ill-suited to assessing both income and multidimensional poverty in urban contexts. However, not enough is known about the extent to which these issues affect the resulting estimates. This paper contributes to the existing literature by illustrating the scale of the bias associated with common practices in measuring urban poverty at different stages of the production of poverty estimates.

Using nationally representative household level data from Nepal, we investigate the links between a household’s fertility decisions and variations in their size and composition. We show that the relationship between number of births and household size is positive when the mothers are young, but becomes negative as the mothers grow older. Elderly couples who had fewer children host, on average, more relatives who are outside the immediate family unit. This result sheds light on the heterogeneous relation between the number of children and household size over the life cycle. It also implies that reductions in a household’s fertility may have an ambiguous impact on its per capita consumption, which depends on how the household’s composition responds to new births and changes over time: in this sample, an old household’s per capita consumption is not affected by the number of births.

In particular, the model predicts that corruption negatively affects the stock of international investment in the host country. In addition, the model predicts that growth should be impaired by the uncertainty caused by corruption. Bribes, unlike taxes, involve unpredictable distortion in the discretionary and uncertain use of the government power. This results in additional costs to businesses and alongside with resources allocated to unproductive activities impose an extra burden on the economy. We test empirically the predictions of the theory using a sample of 142 countries for the period 1994–2014 and GMM methods. Using indicators of control of corruption from the World Bank, the lack of corruption is found to have a positive and statistically significant effect on the growth rate of real per capital GDP and increased the investment ratio. Hence, the empirical results suggest that corruption directly hinders economic growth by hampering investment. The estimated effects are robust to changes in specifications and estimation methods. Thus, it can be concluded that richer countries with better access to international financing should be growing faster and be less prone to the adverse effects of corruption than the emerging economies.",42,5,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:103:y:2018:i:c:p:323-335,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.10.028,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v103y2018icp323-335.html,2020-03-09 19:53:59," 2018, Volume 103, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

The study found that these exchanges, spilling over caste or class boundaries, serve as valuable informal safety nets and contribute to household resilience. Researchers seeking to strengthen community coping strategies should pursue such polices and institutional interventions which strengthen women's resource exchange and exploitation mechanisms. We offer in the end a 4-E model involving exchange, expertise, ethics, and environmental consciousness which describes how these empower women and help in articulation of their unique coping strength at intra- and inert-community levels.

Hirschman’s famous Principle of the Hiding Hand describes an unconscious predisposition of project managers: Projects are launched in the belief that one is prepared for every possible future difficulty. However, some potential problems are overlooked during the planning phase and surprisingly might surface later—making it necessary to deal with them. Recently, this concept was statistically tested by Bent Flyvbjerg in World Development, who concluded that the Principle is “wrong”, “biased” and “potentially disastrous.” However, it is not the Principle of the Hiding Hand that is faulty, but the methodological approach taken by Flyvbjerg. In fact, Flyvbjerg’s analysis is a telling example of what can go wrong if we assess the value of qualitative scholarship merely through the lens of large-n case quantitative analysis. Flyvbjerg seems to overlook both the context of the Hiding Hand and its connection to the work of Albert Hirschman.

This states that development projects typically incur major cost overruns and other implementation problems, which put in question the decision to launch them in the first place. Indeed, had these difficulties been known in advance, the projects might never have been tried. Flyvbjerg challenges the empirical validity of this principle and the sloppiness of Hirschman’s own argument. This rejoinder, while accepting that Hirschman presents his argument less than well, argues that Flyvbjerg is too quick to dismiss it, and that by taking account of Hirschman’s scholarship more broadly, much of his approach remains valuable.",2,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:103:y:2018:i:c:p:366-368,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.10.015,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v103y2018icp366-368.html,2020-03-09 19:54:10," 2018, Volume 103, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
760,Beneficial or Detrimental Ignorance: The Straw Man Fallacy of Flyvbjerg’s Test of Hirschman’s Hiding Hand,"['Ika, Lavagnon A.']","In a recent paper in this journal, “The Fallacy of Beneficial Ignorance: A Test of Hirschman’s Hiding Hand”, Professor Bent Flyvbjerg claims that there is no such thing as beneficial ignorance and that ignorance is detrimental to project success. Moreover, he argues that if Hirschman’s principle of the Hiding Hand were correct, then benefit overruns would exceed cost overruns. Thus, with a statistical test, he demonstrates that the Hiding Hand is in fact less common than its “evil twin”, the Planning Fallacy. In this rejoinder, the author shows that Flyvbjerg’s test is built on a straw man fallacy and that he fails to refute the Hiding Hand. Contrary to Flyvbjerg—who focuses on the narrow costs and benefits—this paper provides evidence that while the Hiding Hand is found among projects that are project management failures but project successes, the Planning Fallacy fits with projects that are both project management and project failures. On that basis, the author analyzes a sample of 161 World Bank-funded projects of different types and finds that the Hiding Hand prevails. While future research should ascertain this finding, the author then points out the methodological limitations of Flyvbjerg’s test. Indeed, it is ironic that the Hiding Hand, a principle crafted against the very idea of cost–benefit analysis, is refuted on that very basis. Even worse, Flyvbjerg, in his cost–benefit analysis, ignores the full life-cycle project costs and benefits, the unintended project effects, the difficulties, and problem-solving abilities so dear to Hirschman, and, thus, treats the management of projects as a kind of “black box”. Finally, the author submits that Hirschman was a behavioral project theorist, and argues that it is more important to shed light on the circumstances where the Hiding Hand works than to question whether the principle of the Hiding Hand is right.",11,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:103:y:2018:i:c:p:369-382,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.10.016,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v103y2018icp369-382.html,2020-03-09 19:54:14," 2018, Volume 103, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Specifically, I show this happens in one fifth of projects, based on the best and largest dataset that exists. But that was not the main question I set out to answer. My main question was whether the Hiding Hand is ""typical,"" as claimed by Hirschman. I show this is not the case, with 80 percent of projects not displaying Hiding Hand behavior. Finally, I agree it would be important to better understand the circumstances where the Hiding Hand actually works. However, if you want to understand how projects ""typically"" work, as Hirschman said he did, then the theories of the planning fallacy, optimism bias, and strategic misrepresentation - according to which cost overruns and benefit shortfalls are the norm - will serve you significantly better than the principle of the Hiding Hand.

Markets provide economic opportunity, but without effective governance, high demand can drive resource degradation. In the context of small-scale sea cucumber fisheries in Yucatán, Mexico, this study documents local governance responses to new markets and identifies factors driving those responses. We conducted a comparative case study of two SSF communities, collecting participant observation and interview data during 16months of fieldwork. Our study found that local rules-in-use did not match government regulations and that the emergence of local rules was shaped by relations of production in each study site. Specifically, patron–client relationships promoted an open access regime that expanded local fishing fleets while fishing cooperatives attempted to restrict access to local fishing grounds through collective action and multi-level linkages with government. We propose that the different material incentives arising from the way that patron–client relationships and cooperatives organize labor, capital, and profits help explain these divergent governance responses. We hypothesize that this finding is generalizable beyond the study context, especially given that patron–client relationships and cooperatives are common throughout the world’s SSFs. This finding builds on previous research that indicates local institutions can mediate the effects of market pressures, showing that the emergence of local rules depends on how resource users are organized not just in relation to resource governance but vis-à-vis the markets themselves. Therefore, effective policies for SSFs facing market pressures require a greater emphasis on regulating local-level trade and governing the commercial aspects of fishing livelihoods. These lessons are relevant to the estimated 540 million individuals whose livelihoods SSFs support who may increasingly engage in the global seafood trade.",10,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:102:y:2018:i:c:p:57-70,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.09.006,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v102y2018icp57-70.html,2020-03-09 19:54:32," 2018, Volume 102, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Distance to Comparative Advantage, Export Diversification and Sophistication, and the Dynamics of Specialization","['Lectard, Pauline', 'Rougier, Eric']","Since the 1990’s, developing countries have tried to promote export diversification and sophistication, notably by attracting vertical FDI and by supporting the emergence of new industries whose factor content is distant from the country’s endowment. We investigate whether defying comparative advantage has prompted a more sophisticated and diversified export basket in a large panel of countries over the period 1992–2012. We find that developing countries that defy their comparative advantage tend to export more manufactured items and manufacturing goods that are more sophisticated. As for export diversification, the impact is heterogeneous across development levels: although defying comparative advantage seems to help diversify the export baskets of middle-income and resource-rich countries, it tends to concentrate those of lower-income economies. Moreover, we find that the impact of the distance to comparative advantage on productive transformation is strongly conditioned by the size of FDI stocks and by the country’s specialization in the lower added-value productive tasks of global value chains (GVCs). More specifically, our results suggest that defying comparative advantage by attracting FDI may be a dangerous strategy in the long-term since it tends to bring only partial and artefact industrialization, with manufacturing exports increasing while the manufacturing value-added actually decreases.",100,7,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:102:y:2018:i:c:p:90-110,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.09.012,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v102y2018icp90-110.html,2020-03-09 19:54:40," 2018, Volume 102, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

The empirical evidence suggests that undertaking ODI leads to an increase in the innovation performance of these Chinese firms. The impact of ODI on innovation is contingent on firm characteristics such as in-house R&D, strategic orientation, and international experiences as well as contextual factors associated with investment destinations and industry contexts. We also find that learning through ODI is a complex process. There is a substitution between ODI and in-house R&D in Chinese MNEs.

SDG5 also recognizes the value of women’s economic empowerment, entailing equal rights to economic resources and full participation at all levels in economic decisions. Also according to SDG5, eliminating harmful practices—such as child marriage before age 18—is a prerequisite for women’s economic empowerment. Using national data for 4,129 married women 15–43years who took part in the Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS 1998–2012), we performed autoregressive, cross-lagged panel analyses to assess whether women’s first marriage in adulthood (at 18years or older, as reported in 2006), was positively associated with their long-term post-marital economic empowerment, measured as their engagement in market work and latent family economic agency in 2012. Women’s first marriage in adulthood had positive unadjusted associations with their market work and family economic agency in 2012. These associations persisted after accounting for market work and family economic agency in 2006, pre-marital resources for empowerment, and cumulative fertility.

This paper quantifies the labor market and poverty effects of Honduran minimum wages from 2005 to 2012. Using 13 household surveys as repeated cross-sections, I estimate the net effects of minimum wage hikes using variation from annual reforms to multiple minimum wages, a 60% increase, and changes in the number of minimum wage categories. Evidence shows that employers are partially complying with minimum wage laws, and respond to hikes by increasing their level of non-compliance. Higher minimum wages reduce covered (formal) employment and increase uncovered (informal) employment. Formal sector wages increase but greater labor supply in the informal sector leads to a negative net effect on wages. This last result is often empirically ambiguous, although consistent with the dual-sector minimum wage model. I find no evidence that minimum wages reduce extreme or moderate poverty.",51,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:102:y:2018:i:c:p:135-157,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.09.015,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v102y2018icp135-157.html,2020-03-09 19:54:51," 2018, Volume 102, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Accountability studies increasingly acknowledge that studying one type of accountability relation at a time is too restrictive. Our study aims to correct for this and explores the effectiveness of combinations of different accountability mechanisms. We take the World Development Report’s accountability triangle as a starting point and adapt it in three ways. First, we refine the long route to accountability into three tracks by differentiating between the three groups of demand side actors; political accountability (opposition), citizen-led, and civil-society-led social accountability. Second, for each track we take into account the demand and supply side and the availability of supply–demand interfaces. Finally, we adopt a holistic approach through the simultaneous incorporation of both the short and long (with the different tracks) routes. To test its usefulness, we use our refined accountability framework to study the accountability constellations and their link to performance in Uganda’s rural water sector. Building on QCA, our findings identify the long three track route (supply—interface—all three demand actors) and the citizen-led social accountability route as viable routes to high water service performance in Ugandan districts. Additionally, a set of new hybrid accountability arrangements are identified while—contrary to theoretical assumptions—the short route (clients to service providers) does not prove effective.",11,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:102:y:2018:i:c:p:158-169,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.09.018,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v102y2018icp158-169.html,2020-03-09 19:54:55," 2018, Volume 102, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

(Null) Answers from Latin America,"['Baker, Andy', 'Velasco-Guachalla, Vania Ximena']","Scholars have produced a limited understanding of the effect of informal labor status on a worker’s political attitudes and behavior. We present descriptive evidence on the micropolitical correlates of informality using direct measures of the concept in public opinion surveys from 18 Latin American countries. We test three scholarly impressions of informal workers—that they are less politically engaged, more right-leaning, and more favorable toward noncontributory social programs than formal-sector workers. These are grounded in a dualist conception of labor markets that views the formal and informal sectors as having little overlap. We find minimal evidence for these impressions and argue that recent empirical findings consistent with a revisionist view of informality better account for our null results. According to this view, informal and formal labor markets are highly integrated, which, we argue, melds together the economic interests and political preferences of individuals in both sectors.

773,"Bamboo Beating Bandits: Conflict, Inequality, and Vulnerability in the Political Ecology of Climate Change Adaptation in Bangladesh","['Sovacool, Benjamin K.']","Bangladesh contributes little to global greenhouse gas emissions, yet it is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Based on semi-structured research interviews as a conduit to a literature review, this paper shows how the processes of enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment impede the vitality of its climate change adaptation efforts. Enclosure refers to when adaptation projects transfer public assets into private hands or expand the roles of private actors into the public sphere. Exclusion refers to when adaptation projects limit access to resources or marginalize particular stakeholders in decision-making activities. Encroachment refers to when adaptation projects intrude on biodiversity areas or contribute to other forms of environmental degradation. Entrenchment refers to when adaptation projects aggravate the disempowerment of women and minorities, or worsen concentrations of wealth and income inequality within a community. In the case of Bangladeshi, climate change policies implemented under the country’s National Adaptation Program of Action have enabled elites to capture land through public servants, the military, and even gangs carrying bamboo sticks. Exclusionary forms of adaptation planning exist at both the national and local scales. Climate protection measures have encroached upon village property, char (public) land, forests, farms, and other public commons. Most egregiously, community coping strategies for climate change have entrenched class and ethnic hierarchies ultimately trapping the poor, powerless, and displaced into a predatory patronage system that can aggravate human insecurity and intensify violent conflict. Planners and practitioners of adaptation need to become more cognizant of the potential for projects to harm others, or admit complicity in the processes of enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment, if they are ever to be eliminated.",13,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:102:y:2018:i:c:p:183-194,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.10.014,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v102y2018icp183-194.html,2020-03-09 19:55:02," 2018, Volume 102, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Sustainability standards, such as Fairtrade, play an important role in agri-food markets of horticultural produce and may be a tool to address these concerns. However, so far the implications of Fairtrade certification for extrinsic and intrinsic employment factors of hired labor on large-scale plantations remain hardly understood. In this paper we assess its effect on workers’ hourly wages and their level of job satisfaction with primary survey data from 325 randomly sampled workers from eight different export-oriented pineapple companies in Ghana. We apply a linear, linear mixed model, and instrumental variable approach to take into account the multilevel characteristics of our data and possible selection bias. Our findings show that both hourly wages and job satisfaction are indeed higher on Fairtrade-certified plantations. Factors of increased job satisfaction are likely driven by higher wages, permanent employment contracts, training opportunities, company services such as medical care and paid leave as well as established labor unions on Fairtrade-certified plantations.",29,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:102:y:2018:i:c:p:195-212,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.09.020,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v102y2018icp195-212.html,2020-03-09 19:55:06," 2018, Volume 102, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
775,Fisheries’ Property Regimes and Environmental Outcomes: A Realist Synthesis Review,"['McLain, Rebecca', 'Lawry, Steven', 'Ojanen, Maria']","Our paper describes the application of a realist approach to synthesizing evidence from 31 articles examining the environmental outcomes of marine protected areas governed under different types of property regimes. The development of resource tenure interventions that promote sustainable management practices has been challenged by the difficulties of determining how contextual factors affect environmental outcomes given the complexity of socio-ecological systems. Realist synthesis is a promising evidence review technique for identifying the mechanisms that influence policy intervention outcomes in complex systems. Through a combination of inductive and deductive analysis of the links between context, mechanisms, and outcomes, realist synthesis can help clarify when, how, where, and why property regime interventions are likely to result in positive environmental outcomes. Our study revealed the importance of disaggregating property regimes into sub-categories, rather than treating them as homogenous categories. More importantly, use of a realist synthesis approach allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which three mechanisms—perceptions of legitimacy, perceptions of the likelihood of benefits, and perceptions of enforcement capacity—interact under different socio-ecological contexts to trigger behavioral changes that affect environmental conditions. The approach revealed the multi-faceted and interactive nature of perceptions of legitimacy, in which legal legitimacy, social acceptability, and ecological credibility combined to create robust legitimacy. The existence of robust legitimacy in turn appeared to be an important contributor to the success of regulatory systems reliant on voluntary compliance. Our study contributes to the field of natural resources governance by demonstrating the utility of a systematic review method which has received little attention by property scholars but which has promise to clarify understanding of how complex systems work. Our study also highlights that achieving long-term sustainability requires paying greater attention to the mechanisms that support or undermine people’s willingness to voluntarily engage in conservation behaviors.",8,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:102:y:2018:i:c:p:213-227,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.09.016,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v102y2018icp213-227.html,2020-03-09 19:55:10," 2018, Volume 102, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Our dataset is from the 2011, 2013, and 2015 results of the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Survey in Viet Nam. Using the Heckman technique to control for sample selection bias, the estimates do not provide evidence for discrimination against female-owned enterprises in the formal lending market. Specifically, female entrepreneurs have a higher probability of getting a loan and they pay lower interest rates in comparison with male entrepreneurs. No discrimination in formal credit markets may arise from the preference for informal loans over formal loans as entrepreneurs tend to borrow informal loans before applying for formal ones.

This paper presents both cross-country and panel-data evidence on the causal factors driving the recent turnaround in Africa’s growth and takes the unique approach of disaggregating the separate growth impacts of Africa’s bilateral trade with: China, Europe, and America. The empirical analysis presented in this paper suggests that the primary and most robust causal factors driving Africa’s recent growth turnaround are private sector and foreign direct investment. Although empirical evidence of the role of bilateral trade openness in Africa’s recent growth emerges within a fixed effect estimation setting, these results are not as robust when endogeneity and other issues are fully accounted for. Among the three major bilateral partners, Africa’s bilateral trade with China has been a relatively important factor spurring growth on the continent and especially so in resource-rich, oil-producing, and non-landlocked countries. The econometric results are not as supportive of growth-inducing effects of foreign aid. These findings emerge after applying a variety of panel data specifications to the data, including the recent fixed effects filtered (FEF) estimator introduced by Pesaran and Zhou (2014) and the dynamic panel generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator, which allows for endogeneity between trade and growth.",112,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:102:y:2018:i:c:p:243-261,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.10.009,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v102y2018icp243-261.html,2020-03-09 19:55:17," 2018, Volume 102, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

The present paper develops an innovative methodology to analyze the distributional changes that occurred and their drivers, with a high degree of accuracy and granularity. Looking at the results from 1991 to 2012, the paper documents how the distributional changes over time hollowed out the middle of the Ghanaian household consumption distribution and increased the concentration of households around the highest and lowest deciles; there was a clear surge in polarization indeed.

Rising obesity rates are the result of changes in people’s diets and lifestyles. Income growth and urbanization are factors that contribute to these changes. Modernizing food retail environments may also play a certain role. For instance, the rapid spread of supermarkets in many developing countries could affect consumer food choices and thus nutritional outcomes. However, concrete evidence about the effects of supermarkets on consumer diets and nutrition is thin. A few existing studies have analyzed related linkages with cross-sectional survey data. We add to this literature by using panel data from households and individuals in urban Kenya. Employing panel regression models with individual fixed effects and controlling for other factors we show that shopping in supermarkets significantly increases body mass index (BMI). We also analyze impact pathways. Shopping in supermarkets contributes to higher consumption of processed and highly processed foods and lower consumption of unprocessed foods. These results confirm that the retail environment affects people’s food choices and nutrition. However, the effects depend on the types of foods offered. Rather than thwarting modernization in the retail sector, policies that incentivize the sale of more healthy foods—such as fruits and vegetables—in supermarkets may be more promising to promote desirable nutritional outcomes.",13,9,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:102:y:2018:i:c:p:292-303,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.07.018,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v102y2018icp292-303.html,2020-03-09 19:55:28," 2018, Volume 102, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

782,Impact of Electrification on Children’s Nutritional Status in Rural Bangladesh,"['Fujii, Tomoki', 'Shonchoy, Abu S.', 'Xu, Sijia']","Access to electricity has the potential to improve the nutritional status of children by a variety of pathways such as increased wealth, reduced fertility through the change in time use, spread of information through technology such as TV, and improved health care services. Yet, the relationship between electrification and children’s nutritional status is rarely explored in the literature. We attempt to fill this lacuna by offering microeconometric evidence from rural Bangladesh, where a rapid expansion of electrification and significant improvement in children’s nutritional status were observed in the past two decades. We find that access to electricity has a positive impact on the nutritional status of children under five as measured by height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) by around 0.1–0.2 points using five rounds of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey from 2000 to 2014. Our results also appear to indicate that the quality of electricity may influence the size of this positive impact. While our analysis of causal pathways is limited by the data availability, it suggests that the positive impact of electrification partially comes from increased wealth. For some years, the positive impact can also be attributed to reduced fertility and information exposure through TV viewing. On the contrary, we find little evidence that the impact is attributable to the improvement of local health facilities. Our findings underscore the importance of evaluating infrastructure programs such as rural electrification from a broad perspective as their impacts may go well beyond the economic benefits considered in a typical cost–benefit analysis. This in turn may encourage governments to invest more in basic infrastructure, which is still severely lacking in Bangladesh and many other countries in the rest of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.",40,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:102:y:2018:i:c:p:315-330,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.07.016,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v102y2018icp315-330.html,2020-03-09 19:55:36," 2018, Volume 102, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

The gender log wage gap at the mean is 55% in 1999–2000 and 49% in 2009–10, but this change is not statistically significant. The Blinder–Oaxaca and the Machado–Mata–Melly decompositions indicate that, in both years, the bulk of the gender wage gap is unexplained, i.e., possibly discriminatory. They also reveal that over the decade, while the wage-earning characteristics of women improved relative to men, the discriminatory component of the gender wage gap also increased. In fact, in 2009–10, if women were “paid like men”, they would have earned more than men on account of their characteristics. In both years, we see the existence of the “sticky floor”, in that gender wage gaps are higher among low-wage earners and lower for high-wage earners. Over the ten-year period, we find that the sticky floor became “stickier” for RWS women.

The economics literature on the links between property rights and investment decisions has amassed; yet due to the necessity of water for life, the high fixed costs associated with water infrastructure construction, and the positive externalities that can result from water provision, it is not obvious how water services might respond to land tenure improvements. Utilizing the phased-in program timing in a quasi-experimental design, we exploit the differences in implementation timing across space in conjunction with the differences in program impact across households that held property titles prior to the project and those that did not. Results from this modified difference-in-differences method indicate that land titling is associated with small in magnitude, but statistically significant increases in water access. Larger gains in sanitation and electricity services are found. We investigate the channels through which this improved access occurs and find evidence of investments in all three services via either government or water utilities. We find evidence of individual household investment only in the case of sanitation. Taken together, these results indicate that land titles are important, but not sufficient to increase access to water and other services.",39,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:102:y:2018:i:c:p:345-357,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.07.011,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v102y2018icp345-357.html,2020-03-09 19:55:43," 2018, Volume 102, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
785,Does Resilience Capacity Reduce the Negative Impact of Shocks on Household Food Security? Evidence from the 2014 Floods in Northern Bangladesh,"['Smith, Lisa C.', 'Frankenberger, Timothy R.']","Using data collected before and after the catastrophic flooding that took place in northern Bangladesh in 2014, this paper contributes to the growing evidence on the factors enhancing households’ resilience to shocks, or their “resilience capacities”. The analysis takes into account all three dimensions of resilience capacity—absorptive, adaptive, and transformative—as well as a broad range of specific capacities supporting them. In addition to disaster preparedness and mitigation, it finds suggestive evidence that the following capacities reduced the negative impact of the flooding on household food security: social capital, human capital, exposure to information, asset holdings, livelihood diversity, safety nets, access to markets and services, women’s empowerment, governance, and psycho-social capabilities such as aspirations and confidence to adapt. The paper highlights the importance of taking a comprehensive approach to understanding the determinants of resilience in future research, one that accounts for the full range of potential capacities. It also points to the value of taking a cross-sectoral, multi-intervention approach to on-the-ground resilience programing in Bangladesh and other developing-country areas that are increasingly vulnerable to climate shocks.",7,10,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:102:y:2018:i:c:p:358-376,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.07.003,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v102y2018icp358-376.html,2020-03-09 19:55:47," 2018, Volume 102, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
786,"Agency, Human Dignity, and Subjective Well-being","['Hojman, Daniel A.', 'Miranda, Álvaro']","In the last decades, our understanding of human well-being and development has shifted from a traditional focus on income and consumption toward a richer multidimensional approach. This shift has been strongly influenced by a body of research in subjective well-being (SWB) and the capabilities’ approach, which emphasizes the role of freedom, opportunities, and social inclusion on well-being. Using a novel nationally representative survey of Chilean households, this paper explores the relationship between life satisfaction and two “hidden dimensions” of development, agency, and human dignity. Human agency refers to the capability of an individual to control her destiny and make choices to fulfill goals set autonomously. Human dignity is associated with the absence of feelings of shame and humiliation, and is ultimately related to social inclusion. We use a method that allows to isolate the impact of personality traits affecting both SWB and capabilities’ perceptions. Our results show that agency and shame are important predictors of life satisfaction, comparable in magnitude to the effect of income variables. The fact that capabilities that measure freedoms and social inclusion are aligned with well-being measures lends support to the view of human development as integral process. Policies to advance agency, and reduce shame and discrimination are discussed. In the case of shame and discrimination we emphasize the role of interventions that influence stigmatization and group boundaries.",26,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:101:y:2018:i:c:p:1-15,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.07.029,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v101y2018icp1-15.html,2020-03-09 19:55:51," 2018, Volume 101, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

However, the effect of food standards—as a particular important non-tariff measure—on agricultural trade flows remains unclear. We contribute to the debate with a unique dataset that contains the number of food processing firms of 87 countries from 2008 to 2013 that are certified with the International Featured Standard (IFS). We estimate a gravity model using the one-year lag of IFS as well as IFS certification in neighboring countries as an instrument to address potential endogeneity. We find that IFS increases c.p. bilateral exports on average of seven agricultural product categories in both specifications. However, the effect remains robust only for high- and middle-income countries and disappears for low-income countries. Hence, while IFS increases exports on average, low-income countries do not benefit in terms of higher export volumes. Moreover, once we separate the dataset by sector, the trade-enhancing effect remains for bakery, dairy, and beverage sectors only. Overall, we argue that food standards are not a suitable development tool to integrate low-income countries into high-value chains per se.",0,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:101:y:2018:i:c:p:16-27,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.08.004,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v101y2018icp16-27.html,2020-03-09 19:55:54," 2018, Volume 101, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Evidence on the effects of country health expenditures on longevity is mixed. We evaluate the heterogeneity in country health expenditure effects throughout the life expectancy distribution worldwide during 2006–11 using quantile regression and an assembled dataset on 175 countries that includes both historic as well as recent data on life expectancy. Our goal is to evaluate the effects of health expenditures across quantiles of the country-level life expectancy distribution to understand whether increasing expenditures are associated with changes in longevity disparities between countries. We find significant heterogeneity in expenditure effects on life expectancy. The largest returns from increased spending are at the left margin of the life expectancy distribution. The results suggest that increasing health spending in countries with low life expectancy may have important returns to life expectancy and significantly diminish global inequalities in longevity and development by reducing the spread of the world’s life expectancy distribution.,0,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:101:y:2018:i:c:p:28-36,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.08.003,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v101y2018icp28-36.html,2020-03-09 19:55:58," 2018, Volume 101, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
789,"State Capacity and Health Outcomes: Comparing Argentina’s and Chile’s Reduction of Infant and Maternal Mortality, 1960–2013","['Brieba, Daniel']","There is substantial quantitative evidence linking higher state capacity to better health outcomes, but scant attention has been paid to the specific mechanisms through which this causal influence operates. The problem is compounded by the considerable diversity of ways in which the influence of the state on development outcomes has been conceptualized, making it hard for practitioners to extract policy lessons from this literature. In this study, I seek to help to address both of these problems through a historical-comparative examination of the ways in which state capacity affected infant and maternal mortality reduction in Argentina and Chile over the last half century. I show that Chile’s greater investment in health-specific state capacities was behind the remarkable historical “reversal of fortune” between these two countries in terms of infant and maternal mortality levels from 1960 to the present, as well as behind Chile’s notorious reduction in the territorial inequality of these outcomes. I show the key difference between the two countries was the quality, reach, and homogeneity of their respective public health systems. From a theoretical standpoint, I argue that the notions of bureaucratic quality and infrastructural power are both necessary and complementary perspectives through which to conceptualize state capacity and understand its causal influence over health and other desirable developmental outcomes. In turn, this suggests that a useful way to specify calls for better “governance” and to achieve better long-run health performance may be to invest in the public health system’s technical (bureaucratic) autonomy and in its system-wide planning and coordination capacities.",0,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:101:y:2018:i:c:p:37-53,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.08.011,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v101y2018icp37-53.html,2020-03-09 19:56:02," 2018, Volume 101, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Take-up does not increase when participants receive information about the product, or an assistance to register, or small subsidies of 2, 10, or 30%. Take-up does not increase when the same information is provided by local respected community leaders, when participants are offered an in-kind gift (a chicken) if they register, when participants are offered the possibility to contribute lower and more frequent payments, or the possibility to pay by cellphone. A full subsidy generates a mere 45% take-up (with no retention after one year). In contrast to these low take-up rates, presenting the same information without any subsidies to existing informal groups raises take-up to 12% (still 7% after one year), as well as trust and knowledge of the product. Social networks play a major role in the adoption of health insurance. This paper provides a cost-effective way to increase take-up of health insurance, while subsidies are found to be largely ineffective at raising take-up in the long run.",0,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:101:y:2018:i:c:p:54-72,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.08.001,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v101y2018icp54-72.html,2020-03-09 19:56:05," 2018, Volume 101, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Gender Wage Gaps in Formal and Informal Jobs in Urban Brazil,"['Ben Yahmed, Sarra']","In developing countries, a large share of employees work informally and are not covered by employment protection legislation. I study how gender inequality differs across formal and informal wage-earners in urban Brazil. The raw gender wage gap is about the same on average in informal jobs (5%) as in formal jobs (7%), but I show that this difference is the result of different male and female selection processes. First, female employees have better observable characteristics than male employees, for example in terms of educational attainment. After controlling for observable characteristics, the adjusted gender wage gap is on average about 24% among formal employees and about 20% among informal employees. Second, men and women entering formal and informal jobs have different unobservable characteristics. Controlling for endogenous selection into formal vs. informal jobs, I find that the gender gap in wage offers is high and increases with education in formal jobs. In informal jobs, however, estimated wage offers are the same for men and women.

We construct a new database of studies of these programs that report impacts on food security outcomes and asset formation. Our meta-analysis finds that social protection programs improve both the quantity and quality of food consumed by beneficiaries. The magnitudes of these effect sizes are meaningful. The average social protection program increases the value of food consumed/expenditure by 13% and caloric acquisition by 8%. Food expenditure rises faster than caloric acquisition because households use transfers to improve the quality of their diet, most notably increasing their consumption of calories from animal source foods. Since the consumption of animal source foods in these populations is low, and because there are significant nutritional benefits to increasing the consumption of these, this is a positive outcome. Our meta-analysis also finds that social protection programs lead to increased asset holdings as measured by livestock, non-farm productive assets, farm productive assets, and savings.

Evidence from Jamaica’s PATH,"['Stampini, Marco', 'Martinez-Cordova, Sofia', 'Insfran, Sebastian', 'Harris, Donna']","Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs have become the main anti-poverty program in many Latin American and Caribbean countries. While numerous rigorous impact evaluations have shown that they have been successful in increasing school enrollment and attendance, the evidence on learning achievement is still mixed, and there are no studies that analyze the effect on school placement. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that the Programme of Advancement through Health and Education (PATH), Jamaica’s CCT program, contributes to breaking the intergenerational poverty cycle by placing its urban beneficiaries on a higher educational trajectory. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that PATH urban male beneficiaries who sat the Grade Six Achievement Test (GSAT) over the period 2010–14 performed better on the test (scoring 22.48 points, or 5.1%, higher than non-beneficiaries); consequently, they were placed in better secondary schools (7.2 percentiles higher in a national school ranking based on preprogram GSAT scores).

While consumers, mostly in developed countries, are willing to pay significant premiums for the certification of such standards, it is not well understood how effectively these incentives are transmitted to producing countries. We study VSS—more in particular Fair Trade and Organic certification—in Ethiopia’s coffee sector, the country’s most important export commodity, using a unique census of transaction data at the export level and large-scale data at the production level. We find that transmission of export quality premiums to coffee producers is limited, with only less than one-third of this premium being passed on, and we find limited evidence of effects due to communal investments. Moreover, as quality premiums are small and average production levels in these settings are low, we estimate that these premiums would only lead to an increased income for coffee farmers of 22 USD per year even with a perfect transmission scenario, and therefore would have little impact on the welfare of the average coffee farmer. Given that the VSS studied are characterized by the highest premiums among VSS schemes, it can be assumed that even lower benefits from other VSS certification schemes trickle down to producers.",0,4,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:101:y:2018:i:c:p:119-132,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.08.010,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v101y2018icp119-132.html,2020-03-09 19:56:20," 2018, Volume 101, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

We use three measures of forest user group collective action, including membership in the Nepal Community Forestry Programme (CFP). Collective action shows large, positive, and statistically significant carbon effects vis-à-vis communities exhibiting no evidence of forest collective action, which do not necessarily correspond with results for other measures of forest quality. We find that depending on the collective action definition and physiographic region, forests controlled by communities exhibiting no evidence of forest collective action may have as little as 34% of the carbon of forests governed under collective action. We do not, however, find evidence that CFP forests, our narrowest measure of collective action, store more carbon than forests outside the CFP.

Evidence from Emerging Markets,"['Webster, Allan', 'Piesse, Jenifer']","An extensive literature exists on the adverse effects of corruption on inward FDI and the impact this may have on economic development but the reverse causality has not been fully explored. Legislation in the US and the EU prohibits firms from engaging in corrupt practices in foreign countries and this suggests that foreign-owned firms might be less likely to pay bribes. However, such legislation may be ineffective because foreign firms have to adapt to local market conditions or risk being uncompetitive. Using firm-level data for 41 emerging countries, a probit model estimates the probability that a firm pays bribes. To allow for possible endogeneity this probit analysis is repeated with an instrument to proxy for endogenous foreign ownership. Then, a propensity score matching technique tests for differences in the propensity to pay bribes by domestic and foreign firms. The paper finds no difference in the behavior of foreign-owned and domestic firms with respect to corrupt practices. Results are robust to different levels of foreign ownership and support the view that foreign-owned firms adapt to local practices and are neither more nor less likely to pay bribes than comparable domestic firms. The paper finds that other variables including bureaucracy, government contracts, and perceived difficulties with civil society (legal and political) do have statistically significant effects on increasing bribery and that some others, such as per capita GDP, tend to reduce bribery.

Promoted by international NGOs, SG models are inspired by indigenous savings and credit associations (ROSCAs). SG models however differ in that they prescribe lending the pooled savings to group members for an interest. The interest rate aims to (1) boost capital accumulation, (2) allocate scarce capital efficiently, and (3) remunerate and incentivize savers. This paper builds on a six-month fieldwork conducted in DR Congo consisting of direct observations of SG meetings and interviews with SG participants and practitioners. We study the gaps between SG practitioners’ objectives and SG participants’ perceptions and practices related to the interest rate. Our research pays particular attention to the local context and local norms that interfere with SG practitioners’ objectives. Our analysis highlights three gaps. First, SG participants turn savings into credit for security purposes rather for rapid capital accumulation. Second, credit allocation decisions are guided by fairness and security concerns rather than efficiency. Third, SG participants often regard the accumulated interest as belonging to the group and to active borrowers rather than to passive savers.

Lessons from three main ongoing international financing mechanisms have been drawn, including the United Nations (UN) membership dues, Official Development Assistance (ODA), and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The indexes that reflect historical emission responsibility (HR) and ability to pay (AP) are also used to share the burden. Results reveal that the ongoing international financing mechanisms vary in their burden sharing results and the shares of existing donors are driven by highly complex reasons. Weighting the HR, UN, and GEF approaches with the Preference Score Compromises (PSC) method could yield a compromise scheme in which the regional contributions are highly similar to those under the GCF initial resource mobilization from 2015 to 2018. GCF financing heavily depends on contributions from the developed countries even if the donor parties are extended to emerging economics. This paper also finds that the decision of the United States to withdraw from climate finance will significantly increase the burden for other donors, particularly for the European Union the contribution share of which is predicted to increase to nearly 14 percentage points.

To investigate this, we empirically analyze how cooperative behavior develops in a lab-in-the-field experiment with mixed groups of CDR program beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, organized in 42 municipalities in Colombia with active CDR programs. In the experiment, we use two rounds of a binary public goods game with a communication stage between both rounds. The experimental data are complemented with information on pre-existing social proximity among the participants and whether they have participated in a CDR program.

Yet despite an extensive literature exploring the effects of conservation on human livelihoods, there is a lack of robust evidence about which type of conservation intervention works, for whom, and how. This is partly because the social impacts of conservation interventions often affect multiple aspects of human well-being, with changes taking place over long periods during which unintended feedbacks can occur. This paper assesses the medium-term impacts of Protected Areas (PAs) and of three Payment for Environmental Services (PES) projects on three socio-economic indicators across 16 villages in Northern Cambodia. We present a multi-period evaluation including three panel surveys over six years from villages inside and outside PAs to clarify the mechanisms through which social effects of conservation take place and how this translates into the development pathways adopted by households. While livelihood improvements were recorded across all villages, we found that PAs slightly reduce households’ socio-economic status, though does not impede their development. PAs also protect traditional livelihoods.

We identify the main drivers and impacts of crop and labor diversification which constitute two livelihood strategies on moderating the adaptation deficit. In doing so, we account for the interdependence between the two diversification practices and potential reverse causality between welfare outcomes and diversification behavior. Moreover, we condition the impacts of diversification on different sections of the welfare distribution to capture potential non-linear effects. Our results reveal that the diversification has positive and significant welfare impacts when most vulnerable households rely on it asan adaptation strategy to mid-run climate variability and asa coping strategy to short-run market shocks. At the same time, our results find lower but still positive impacts for well-endowed households that are likely to diversify their activity portfolio. Given the very limited presence of policy support, we conclude that the rural Nigerien communities are characterized by a large and autonomous adaptation response which constitutes a key leverage mechanism for policy makers. We thus suggest government interventions aimed at supporting the most important diversification drivers, but also aimed at straightening some channels, such as network infrastructures or the promotion of local crop varieties, which may have a greater potential in triggering diversification.",0,8,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:101:y:2018:i:c:p:219-234,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.09.004,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v101y2018icp219-234.html,2020-03-09 19:56:46," 2018, Volume 101, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Using bilateral FDI flows’ data from 108 host and 240 home countries over 1990–2012, and employing a variety of estimation techniques together with a rich battery of robustness tests, we find no significant effect of bilateral FDI flows on either host country productivity growth or on the productivity gap between the host and the frontier country.

The face of poverty is primarily rural and young; 80% of the extreme poor and 75% of the moderate poor live in rural areas. Over 45% of the extreme poor are children younger than 15years old, and nearly 60% of the extreme poor live in households with three or more children. Gender differences in poverty rates are muted, and there is scant evidence of gender inequality in poor children’s educational attainment. A sizable share of the extreme and moderate poor, 40 and 50%, respectively, have completed primary school. Compared with the extreme poor, the moderate poor are significantly more likely to have completed primary school and are less likely to work in agriculture. After conditioning on other individual and household characteristics, having fewer than three children, having greater educational attainment, and living in an urban area are strongly and positively associated with welfare. The results reinforce the central importance of households in rural areas and those containing large numbers of children in efforts to reduce extreme poverty, and are consistent with increased educational attainment and urbanization hastening poverty reduction.",0,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:101:y:2018:i:c:p:250-267,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.08.002,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v101y2018icp250-267.html,2020-03-09 19:56:53," 2018, Volume 101, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

Previous studies have examined the effectiveness of individual coping strategies in mitigating the impact of adverse weather shocks, but no study to date has presented a comprehensive evaluation of alternative coping strategies. We employ household panel data spanning 15years to estimate the impact of weather shocks on consumption and poverty dynamics in rural Ethiopia, along with the effectiveness of household coping strategies in alleviating the impact of shocks. We find that rainfall increases are positively associated with per adult equivalent consumption, while high temperatures are negatively associated with consumption. In terms of household coping strategies, formal social safety net transfers mitigate the impact of adverse rainfall shocks on consumption and off-farm employment mitigates the impact of high-temperature shocks. Simulations suggest that rainfall shocks and formal social safety net transfers significantly influence household poverty dynamics. By contrast, high-temperature shocks and off-farm employment have less impact on poverty dynamics.

805,Does Intimate Partner Violence Decline as Women’s Empowerment Becomes Normative? Perspectives of Bangladeshi Women,"['Schuler, Sidney Ruth', 'Nazneen, Sohela']","Studies addressing the relationship between women’s empowerment and intimate partner violence (IPV) have yielded conflicting findings. Some suggest that women’s economic and social empowerment is associated with an increased risk of intimate partner violence (IPV), arguably because men use often IPV to enforce their dominance and reassert inegalitarian gender norms when patriarchal norms are challenged; other studies suggest the converse. It is important to understand why these findings are contradictory to create a more sound basis for designing both women’s empowerment interventions and anti-violence interventions. The aim of this study is to clarify the relationship between women’s empowerment and IPV in a setting where gender roles are rapidly changing and IPV rates are high. We examine some of the ways in which the nature of women’s empowerment evolved in six villages in rural Bangladesh during a 12-year period in which surveys have documented a decline of 11 points in the percentage of married women experiencing IPV in the prior year. The paper is based on data from 74 life history narratives elicited from 2011 to 2013 with recently married Bangladeshi women from the six villages, whom other community residents identified as empowered. Our findings suggest that women’s empowerment has evolved in several ways that may be contributing to reductions in IPV: in its magnitude (for example, many women are earning more income than they previously did), in women’s perceived exit options from abusive marriages, in the propensity of community members to intervene when IPV occurs, and in the normative status of empowerment (it is less likely to be seen as transgressive of gender norms). The finding that community-level perceptions of empowered women can evolve over time may go a long way in explaining the discrepant results in the literature.",0,1,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:101:y:2018:i:c:p:284-292,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.09.005,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v101y2018icp284-292.html,2020-03-09 19:57:01," 2018, Volume 101, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
806,Unleashing Waste-Pickers’ Potential: Supporting Recycling Cooperatives in Santiago de Chile,"['Navarrete-Hernandez, Pablo', 'Navarrete-Hernandez, Nicolas']","The informal economy currently provides two out of three jobs worldwide, with waste-picking activities providing employment for millions of the poorest of society. Moreover, waste-picking could provide a sustainable solution for solving the waste management crisis that affects the 3 billion people lacking access to waste services. Governmental policies toward waste-pickers in particular, and the informal economy in general, have been fundamentally based on four policy approaches: (1) dualist and voluntarist, which proposes repressive policies against waste-picker activity and the expansion of formal solid waste management systems; (2) structuralist, which argues for weak supporting policies aimed at reinforcing waste-picker associations; (3) legalist, which promotes the competition of waste-picking with other recycling alternatives without government intervention; and (4) co-production, which supports waste-picking with local policies as a means of enhancing waste-pickers’ productivity. Both qualitative, and particularly quantitative evidence testing the impact of these four approaches is scarce. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature by operationalizing concepts, building a waste-picker sustainable performance index, and estimating the impacts of these four competing policy approaches. An exploratory sequential design method is used to analyze data: first, a thematic analysis to examine 40 in-depth interviews, and then multiple linear regressions to analyze a census survey of 100 waste-pickers in four cooperatives in Santiago de Chile. Our empirical results suggest a positive association between the level of government support and waste-pickers’ sustainable performance. Consequently, further positive government intervention, particularly in supporting a stronger structural organization for the waste-picker recycling system, is advocated as the primary policy recommendation of this paper.",0,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:101:y:2018:i:c:p:293-310,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.08.016,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v101y2018icp293-310.html,2020-03-09 19:57:05," 2018, Volume 101, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
807,Traps and Sustainable Development in Rural Areas: A Review,"['Haider, L. Jamila', 'Boonstra, Wiebren J.', 'Peterson, Garry D.', 'Schlüter, Maja']","The concept of a poverty trap—commonly understood as a self-reinforcing situation beneath an asset threshold—has been very influential in describing the persistence of poverty and the relationship between poverty and sustainability. Although traps, and the dynamics that lead to traps, are defined and used differently in different disciplines, the concept of a poverty trap has been most powerfully shaped by work in development economics. This perspective is often constraining because, as many studies show, poverty arises from complex interactions between social and environmental factors that are rarely considered in development economics. A more integrated understanding of poverty traps can help to understand the interrelations between persistent poverty and key social and ecological factors, facilitating more effective development interventions. The aim of this paper is to provide a critical appraisal of existing trap conceptualizations in different disciplines, and to assess the characteristics and mechanisms that are used to explain poverty traps in rural contexts, thereby broadening the traps concept to better account for social-ecological interactions. Complementarities and tensions among different disciplinary perspectives on traps are identified, and our results demonstrate that different definitions of traps share a set of common characteristics: persistence, undesirability, and self-reinforcement. Yet these minimum conditions are not sufficient to understand how trap dynamics arise from complex social-ecological interactions. To broaden the utility of the concept we propose a more social-ecologically integrated definition of traps that includes four additional considerations: cross-scale interactions, path dependencies, the role of external drivers, and social-ecological diversity. Including these wider dimensions of trap dynamics would help to better account for the diverse social-ecological feedbacks that produce and maintain poverty traps, and could strengthen strategies to alleviate poverty in a more integrated way.",0,2,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:101:y:2018:i:c:p:311-321,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.05.038,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v101y2018icp311-321.html,2020-03-09 19:57:08," 2018, Volume 101, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
808,Output Value Risk for Commodity Producers: The Uncertain Benefits of Diversification,"['Merener, Nicolas', 'Steglich, Maria Eugenia']","Commodity price volatility has long been recognized as a main risk for commodity producers’ welfare and has led to diversification efforts. Less noticed has been the importance of commodity correlations, and their increase after 2006, in the risk faced by producers. To assess their impact, we perform an empirical analysis of the market value of commodity producers’ output. In a sample of 56 countries producing 26 commodities we find that diversification and correlations strongly explain output value volatility. During 1987–2006, producers effectively specialized in a single commodity had an average output value volatility of 27.0% while producers of three or more commodities had a 12.7% volatility. In this period average correlation was 8% and diversification was very effective. In the 2007–12 period, correlations averaged 26% and output volatilities for specialized and diversified commodities were 30.4% and 19.5% respectively, thus reducing the benefit of diversification at a time of macroeconomic distress. In 2013–16, output volatilities reverted to levels close to those in 1987–2006 as commodities decorrelated again.

This was extended to rural areas of previously unaffected districts in 2007. The natural experiment provided by the step-wise implementation of the removal policy and five waves of nationally representative household survey data enables us to study the impact of the removal policy on utilization and household health expenditure. We find that the policy increased overall use of health services in the short term and the effects were sustained in the long term. The increases were higher for individuals whose household heads were unemployed or had no or less education. The policy also led to a small shift in care seeking from private to publicly supported facilities, an effect driven primarily by individuals whose household heads were either formally employed or engaged in farming. The likelihood of incurring any spending reduced, although this weakened slightly in the long term. At the same time, there was an upward pressure on conditional health expenditure, i.e., expenditure was higher after removal of fees for those who incurred any spending.

But they are often also the precursors to deforestation and other adverse environmental impacts. This paper examines the road-induced tradeoffs between economic growth, deforestation, and biodiversity loss in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Decades of conflict have left the DRC’s transport infrastructure among the sparsest and most dilapidated in the world. Most of the provincial capitals are unconnected to the capital city, and improving road connectivity could lead to a significant boost in trade and economic growth. At the same time the DRC is also home to the second largest rainforest in the world. The iconic Congo forests are a trove of ecological value—some monetizable and most that is not. So the destruction of the DRC’s forests will have significant environmental ramifications. We provide empirical estimates of the economic benefits of improving market access and reducing transportation costs. We then estimate a forest destruction function to assess the impact that new or improved roads have on forest clearing. In addition, a novel biodiversity index is developed to identify forests of high biodiversity significance. Two simulations are performed to quantitatively demonstrate the impacts of road improvement projects in terms of increased GDP, forest loss, and biodiversity that are put at risk.

812,Reconfiguring Frontier Spaces: The territorialization of resource control,"['Rasmussen, Mattias Borg', 'Lund, Christian']","The expansion of capitalism produces contests over the definition and control of resources. On a global scale, new patterns of resource exploration, extraction, and commodification create new territories. This takes place within a dynamic of frontiers and territorialization. Frontier dynamics dissolve existing social orders—property systems, political jurisdictions, rights, and social contracts—whereas territorialization is shorthand for all the dynamics that establish them and re-order space anew. Frontier moments offer new opportunities, and old social contracts give way to struggles over new ones. As new types of resource commodification emerge, institutional orders are sometimes undermined or erased, and sometimes reinterpreted, reinvented, and recycled. New property regimes, new forms of authority, and the attendant struggles for legitimacy over the ability to define proper uses and users follow frontier moments. The drawing of borders and the creation of orders around new resources profoundly rework patterns of authority and institutional architectures. We argue that the territorialization of resource control is a set of processes that precedes legitimacy and authority, fundamentally challenging and replacing existing patterns of spatial control, authority, and institutional orders. It is dynamics of this sort that the articles in this collection explore: the outcomes produced in the frontier space, the kinds of authority that emerge through control over space and the people in it, and the battles for legitimacy that this entails.

Based on 7months of field research in a key gold-producing region of West Kalimantan, I argue that gold’s presence, discovery, and informal extraction creates resource frontiers, and that within these frontiers, mining labor practices, property relations, and gold mining-related secret knowledges converge to generate resource territories. While development practitioners, agrarian scholars, and government officials represent mining sites as chaotic and lacking institutional order, I show that a clearly understood organization of life and work animates the territorial subjects and territorialized spaces that small-scale mining populates in both urban and rural mining territories. The article challenges views of territory and territorialization as an imposition of government on the people and resources within spatial boundaries. Territories with no formalized boundaries in Indonesian gold country emerge through specific production practices engaging labor, resource access, and situated knowledges.

Frontiers and Territorialization around Mount Halimun-Salak National Park, Indonesia","['Lund, Christian', 'Rachman, Noer Fauzi']","Government institutions and local people in Indonesia have entrenched, resurrected, and reinvented space through their different territorial and property claims. From colonial times, onward, government institutions have dissolved local political orders and territorialized and reordered spatial frontiers. Local resource users, on the other hand, have aligned with, or undermined, the spatial ordering. We analyze government-citizen encounters in West Java and the dynamics of recognition in the fields of government territorialization, taxation, local organization, and identity politics. Spatial categories are struggled over, and groups of actors seek to legitimate their presence, their activities, and their resource use by occupation, mapping, and construction of “public” infrastructure. In the case of conservation in the Mount Halimun-Salak National Park, we find that rather than one overarching recognition of a single direct spatial claim to property, a web of direct and indirect claims for recognition emerges between and among claimants and institutions. If direct claims to resources are impossible to pursue, people lodge indirect claims. In everyday situations, indirect recognition can perform important legal and political work. After the authoritarian New Order regime, in particular, claims to citizenship worked as indirect property claims, and indirect recognition of such claims are important because they serve as pragmatic proxies for formal property rights.

815,Paper Works: Contested Resource Histories in Peru’s Huascarán National Park,"['Rasmussen, Mattias Borg']","Resource histories determine how particular parts of the environment come to be defined as valuable. As elsewhere, protected areas in Latin America link the governance of people, territory, and resources by reinterpreting and reclassifying practices and environments. Set in highland Peru, the article focuses on how such revisions imply contestation of both history and future. It explores particular modes of claiming space through an archeology of the claims to knowledge and legitimacy put forward by a national park and a campesino community, respectively. Claims to space entwine with social struggles about local development where territorial claims are based on different notions of history and interpretations of the esthetic and productive values of the landscape. While the park officials navigate interests of conservation, tourism, and extraction, the campesino community mobilizes a different set of values and interests based on their historical occupation of the territories. These processes of contestation over authority and legitimacy highlight different views on the role of landscapes in the history and progress of local communities. Conservation may not only dispossess people of their land and natural resources, but also of labor and territorial sovereignty. This case shows how an Andean campesino community counters such movements by a wide repertoire of legal and social actions that works simultaneously in legal and extra-legal domains. Paper works mediate claims to territorial sovereignty, people, and resources.

Our research examined the attempt of one community at the crater lake Quilotoa (Cotopaxi province) to maintain control of their economy in the face of increased state investments. We asked, under what circumstances is a community able to both define and defend a zone of locally managed economic development? To answer the question, we carried out a participatory GIS mapping project focused on sites of conflict and community assemblies and supplemented the mapping with an economic survey and detailed career histories. Our research finds that, since 1988, cycles of conflicts within the community of Quilotoa and between Quilotoa and its neighbors came to define an effective, yet informal, territorial boundary within which residents were highly committed to mobilize to defend their work and investments.

Drawing on a concrete case in the Selous–Niassa Corridor in Southern Tanzania, we show how a frontier emerged in the form of community-based conservation. Decades of consecutive and continuous territorialization projects, based on mapping and boundary making, have ensured that conservation is beyond questioning, despite failures in the processes of demarcating, controlling, and managing this large-scale socio-spatial intervention. Although these failures produce territorial conflicts and confusions on the ground, we argue that in the context of a conservation frontier the gap between the envisioned ideal and the messy reality is used to legitimize continuous conservation interventions that rely on technical expertise rather than political dialog. While such top–down territorialization by community-based conservation inevitably remains partial and contingent, this is nonetheless a powerful and resilient project that gradually transforms communal landscapes into conservation territories with little room for public debate.",0,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:101:y:2018:i:c:p:453-465,10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.09.010,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v101y2018icp453-465.html,2020-03-09 19:57:45," 2018, Volume 101, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html

The liberalization of the gold mining sector has given way to complex forms of regulation where non-state and illegal mining entrepreneurs compete in governing mining extraction. Taking the case of gold mining in Burkina Faso, this paper analyses the conditions and dynamics under which such complex regulation takes place. We draw on extensive ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Northern Burkina Faso, in particular the Burkinabè mining sector. We argue that enclave economies in the gold mining sector are co-produced by state and market regulation through a “plurification” of regulatory authority. This “plurification” is the effect of competition amongdifferent frontier entrepreneurs, who seek to broker regulatory authority in mining concession sites. We show that concession sites are not discrete extractive enclaves, but are better understood as indiscrete sites that are entangled in local politics and social relations. Rather than thinning social relations, as is often claimed, we observe that enclave economies thicken politics around concessionary regimes, where governmental bodies re-emerge as an arbitrating regulatory force. These findings problematize policy prescriptions to formalize the gold mining sector and draw attention to the role of the state in re/producing frontier entrepreneurs with unequal political rights to claiming concessions.",0,3,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:101:y:2018:i:c:p:466-476,10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.11.002,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v101y2018icp466-476.html,2020-03-09 19:57:49," 2018, Volume 101, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
819,"Frontiers: Authority, Precarity, and Insurgency at the Edge of the State","['Watts, Michael J.']","The focus of this article is two home-grown insurgencies which arose in Nigeria after the return to civilian rule in 1999: Boko Haram in the Muslim northeast, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) in the oil producing and Christian southeast. The two insurgencies arose, I argue, from frontier spaces in which the limits of state authority and legitimacy intersected with a profound crisis of authority and rule on the one hand, and the political economy of radical precarity on the other. Boko Haram and MEND share family resemblances—they are products of the same orderings of power—despite the obvious fact that one is draped in the language of religion and restoration (but as we shall see modernity) and the insistence that Nigeria should become transformed into a true Islamic state, while the other is secular and civic (and also modern) wishing to expand the boundaries of citizenship through a new sort of federalism. There are striking commonalities in the social composition of the armed groups and their internal dynamics; each is deposited at the nexus of the failure of local government, customary institutions, and the security forces (the police and the military task forces in particular). Each, nevertheless, is site specific; a cultural articulation of dispossession politics rooted in regional traditions of warfare, in particular systems of religiosity, and very different sorts of social structure and identity, and very different ecologies (the semi arid savannas of the north, and the creeks and forest of the Niger delta). In both cases state coercion and despotism and the ethico-moral decrepitude of the state figures centrally as does the politics of resentment that each condition generates among a large, alienated but geographically rooted group of precarious classes.",0,0,RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:101:y:2018:i:c:p:477-488,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.03.024,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v101y2018icp477-488.html,2020-03-09 19:57:53," 2018, Volume 101, Issue C","World Development, Elsevier",https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/wdevel.html
