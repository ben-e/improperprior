# Introduction to Bayesian Deep Learning

A basic walkthrough covering basic deep learning from a Bayesian perspective.

## Part 1. A Shallow Introduction to Deep Learning

Like a million other tutorials. Code a simple multilayer perceptron by hand.

## Part 2. A Narrow Introduction to Bayesian Statistics

A quick walkthrough of Bayesian stat, only present what's needed.

## Part 3. Bayesian Deep Learning

Adapt code in Part 1 to a Bayesian setting.

## Part 4. Bayesian Extras

Pruning, uncertainty, and more.

# Training a Neural Networks to Hide Messages

Build a network that hides messages within an image, that can be decrypted with a key-image (i.e. multiply the two modified images to get payload in binary or something) + an adversarial network.
