These are some things I like:

## Blogs

* [Gordon Shotwell's Data Science Blog](https://blog.shotwell.ca/) - I stumbled on Gordon's blog because of a [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21965248) post. I have so far found all of his posts to be very insightful and well thought out.
* [Eric's Movie Blog](https://dweemeister.tumblr.com/) - This is a movie blog run by a friend from undergraduate. His movie reviews are extremely well written.
* [Craig Gidney's Algorithmic Assertions](https://algassert.com/) - This is a fantastic math/computer science blog.

## People

* [Neha Gupta](https://guptane6.github.io/index.html) - Neha is in my M.S. Economics and Computation cohort at Duke. She's interested in topics around privacy and computational economics.
* [Haoming Li](https://haoming.li/) - Haoming is in my M.S. Economics and Computation cohort at Duke. His research on preference elicitation is very interesting.

## Artists

* [Matt Tarpley's Cat's Cafe](https://www.catscafecomics.com/) - Matt writes/illustrates very wholesome comics. [Current favorite](https://www.catscafecomics.com/post/613750137827770368/i-am-trying).
