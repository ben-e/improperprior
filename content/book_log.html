<p>This is some of the media I’ve interacted with, by year.</p>

<h2>2021</h2>
<div id="books" class="section level3">
<h3>Books</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Sword of Destiny</em> - [In Progress]</li>
<li><em>Dune</em> - Dune pulled me in hard after the first few chapters. Herbert builds a very interesting world filled with mostly compelling characters. It also feels like much more modern sci-fi, though I am not particularly well-read, compared to it’s contemporaries. The ending is more ominous than triumphant.</li>
<li><em>The Return of the King</em> - It’s good! It certainly drags a little in places, but overall I really enjoyed it. The whole book is honestly worth reading just for the last few chapters which were cut from the films. They really effectively show the effects of PTSD.</li>
<li><em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>, Agatha Christie - I do enjoy Christie’s books, and this is no exception. Not sure how I feel about the ending.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="games" class="section level3">
<h3>Games</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> - [In Progress]</li>
<li><em>Spiritfarer</em> - [In Progress]</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="movies" class="section level3">
<h3>Movies</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Onward</em> - I liked this movie. Not the best from Pixar, but pretty fun nonetheless.</li>
<li><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</em> - Very good and very pretty, but: (1) why are there elves in Helm’s Deep, (2) what did Peter Jackson do to Faramir?!</li>
</ul>

<h2>2020 (Incomplete)</h2>
<div id="books-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Books</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Gideon the Ninth</em>, Tamsyn Muir - Took me quite a while to get into this book. I really did not like Gideon at first, but the world building really pulled me in.</li>
<li><em>Harrow the Ninth</em>, Tamsyn Muir - I really liked this book, though I’d rather not read a book in the second person again (I do think this pays off for Muir, ultimately).</li>
<li><em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, J.R.R. Tolkien - Really enjoyed this more than I thought I would. Tolkien’s characters can feel a little odd at times, and some passages can feel like a slog to get through, but despite this Tolkien does a great job building tension and (of course) builds a really compelling world.</li>
<li><em>The Two Towers</em>, J.R.R. Tolkien - Most of the same notes from <em>Fellowship</em> apply here, but I think I enjoyed the plot of <em>Towers</em> more. I honestly appreciate that Tolkien’s battle scenes are actually quite brief (unlike say, the movies).</li>
<li><em>The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle</em>, Stuart Turton - This is a well written murder mystery with a fun premise, but it’s ultimately a bit of a let down.</li>
<li><em>Woken Furies</em>, Richard K. Morgan - (Disclaimer: Morgan is not a great person.) Definitely a guilty pleasure book for me, as with the other <em>Altered Carbon</em> books. I did enjoy it though.</li>
<li><em>Ancillary Justice</em>, Anne Leckie - I don’t why, but I had a hard time getting through this book. At the end of the day, I did really enjoy it though. Very cool premise: a ship’s AI downloads itself into one of the bodies it controls to escape a purge, and seeks revenge.</li>
<li><em>Sleeping Giants</em>, Sylvain Neuvel - Not really worth reading.</li>
<li><em>The Last Wish</em>, Andrzej Sapkowski - I really enjoyed this book, especially after watching the Netflix series. It take the form of a series of intertwined short stories that collectively do a great job of building an interesting world and characters I already feel attached to.</li>
</ul>

<div id="games-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Games</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>The Outer Wilds</em> - I really loved this game. It’s premised on the idea that if the world it creates is interesting, the curious will want to explore it. It succeeds wonderfully at this. I found the ending quite touching as well.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="movies-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Movies</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Knives Out</em> - As good as everyone said it was.</li>
<li><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</em> - It’s good, what do you want from me?</li>
</ul>
