<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I’ve seen a number of articles/posts pop up around the internet with lists of data science interview questions. I thought it might be a good exercise in communication and data science knowledge to answer these questions. I am finding it harder than I would have expected to write good (and hopefully useful) answers!</p>

<li><a href="http://alexeygrigorev.com/">Alexey Grigorev</a> has put together a whole GitHub repo with data science interview questions <em>and</em> answers, <a href="https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/data-science-interviews/">available here</a>. He also has his own extensive collection of <a href="https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/data-science-interviews/blob/master/awesome.md">resources</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://chrisalbon.com/">Chris Albon</a> has a collection of machine learning flashcards, <a href="https://machinelearningflashcards.com/">available as a whole set for a price</a>, or sporadically posted <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisalbon">on his Twitter feed</a>. I’ve found these to be a useful way to identify gaps in my knowledge.</li>

<h3>What is supervised machine learning?</h3>
<p>Supervised machine learning is when we use a dataset, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, to predict some known target value <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> might be a label/class or some continuous value. In unsupervised learning we learn about a dataset <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> without any label, for example clustering individuals.</p>

<h2>Linear Regression</h2>

<h3>What is regression? Which models can you use to solve a regression problem?</h3>
<p>In a regression problem we predict a continuous value (rather than a label). Linear regression is very common; it can be augmented with polynomial features or regularization terms (lasso and ridge regression). Many other algorithms can also be used for regression problems, such as random forests with regression trees.</p>

<div id="what-is-linear-regression-when-do-we-use-it" class="section level3">
<h3>What is linear regression? When do we use it?</h3>
<p>For data <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, observation <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, a linear regression predicts a value <span class="math inline">\(y_i = x_i^T\beta\)</span> for a set of coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. We typically assume there to be some error term <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span> that is normally distributed around 0.</p>
<p>Additional notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We can add an extra column of 1s to the data to include an intercept term. The column of 1s allows us to add an extra <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> which (in the case of linear regression with a single variable) changes where on the y-axis the line passes through. Without this term the line will just pass through 0.</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘linear’ in linear regression refers to the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>’s can be polynomials, as in the case of polynomial regression.</p></li>
<li><p>While the <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>’s can be found through a number of techniques, choosing <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> to minimize <span class="math inline">\((y- X\beta)^T(y- X\beta)\)</span> (as is very common, this is just ordinary least squares) gives a very elegant closed form: <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty\)</span>.</p></li>
