<p>I’ve been using the past few weeks to improve my SQL fluency, and I just wanted to share a few quick resources that I’ve found useful.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><a href="https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial"><strong>SQLZoo</strong></a>. The quizzes and questions hit the perfect balance of challenging but not so hard that it breaks my sense of flow.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html"><strong>sqlite3</strong></a> package for Python and <a href="https://db.rstudio.com/databases/sqlite/"><strong>RSQLite</strong></a> package for R. While one certainly could install and use something like PostgreSQL on their laptop (and it’s definitely a useful tool to learn!), I suspect it’s overkill when learning SQL and for most laptop-based projects. The sqlite3 and RSQLite these packages both come with a copy of <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>, and let you write queries in SQL and get results in language-native data types.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it for now, happy querying!</p>
