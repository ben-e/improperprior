<p>Upon seeing this, my first thought was something along the lines of “Well that’s really clever” and my second thought was “how has no one taught me this before, this is high school or intro to probability stuff!” - alternatively, is this something I forgot? was I not so impressed?</p>
<p>While it’s easy to write down the probabilities and see that it works, I still get quite a bit of satisfaction from “seeing” it work as well.</p>
