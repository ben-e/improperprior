<h2>Blogs</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.shotwell.ca/">Gordon Shotwell’s Data Science Blog</a> - I stumbled on Gordon’s blog because of a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21965248">HackerNews</a> post. I have so far found all of his posts to be very insightful and well thought out.</li>
<li><a href="https://dweemeister.tumblr.com/">Eric’s Movie Blog</a> - This is a movie blog run by a friend from undergraduate. His movie reviews are extremely well written.</li>
