# Improper Prior

My name is Ben Ewing. Among many other things I am interested in Bayesian approaches to data science, climbing, cycling, and running. I am currently a data scientist at [Livongo](https://www2.livongo.com/). Please don't be too  afraid to [reach out](mailto:ben.ewing@duke.edu) with any questions.
