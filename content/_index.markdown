I am currently a graduate student at Duke University pursuing a [M.S. in Economics and Computation](https://econ.duke.edu/masters-programs/degree-programs/msec). I enjoy climbing, cycling, and running, as well as hacking on interesting problems (usually in R). I have worked previously in various data science roles and I am currently searching for opportunities following my graduation in May 2020. My resume can be found [here](/ewing_cv_2020_03_09.pdf).
