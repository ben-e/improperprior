<p>Thereâ€™s a lot of bad data science out there.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/FightCOVID19/">FightCOVID19</a>: To me this looks like a blatant attempt to profit (at least reputationally) from the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time I am writing this, it looks like the author of this repo has felt the need to build a massive ecosystem (Android/iOS/Web apps? Whos is this for?) around a <a href="https://github.com/FightCOVID19/core/blob/master/app/model.py">pre-trained Neural Net</a>, updated with COVID-19 victim chest scans. While updating pre-trained models is standard (and very often a good idea!), this author seems much more concerned with appearances than actual research. This was brought to my attention by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/fni5ow/d_why_is_the_ai_hype_absolutely_bonkers/">this</a> (sigh) Reddit post.</li>
</ul>
