There's a lot of bad data science out there.

* [FightCOVID19](https://github.com/FightCOVID19/): To me this looks like a blatant attempt to profit (at least reputationally) from the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time I am writing this, it looks like the author of this repo has felt the need to build a massive ecosystem (Android/iOS/Web apps? Whos is this for?) around a [pre-trained Neural Net](https://github.com/FightCOVID19/core/blob/master/app/model.py), updated with COVID-19 victim chest scans. While updating pre-trained models is standard (and very often a good idea!), this author seems much more concerned with appearances than actual research. This was brought to my attention by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/fni5ow/d_why_is_the_ai_hype_absolutely_bonkers/) (sigh) Reddit post.
