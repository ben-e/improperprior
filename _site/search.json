    "text": "When Quarto was formally released earlier this year, I knew it’d only be a matter of time until I felt the incessant need to transition my oft-neglected blog to this new framework. And so I have!\nWhile the migration itself was straightforward, I struggled to commit to a single color theme. This was compounded by my preference for using a consistent color theme across the website and any blog post plots, meaning that any change in website theme would require a change to each post. Ideally, I would be able to change both the blog color theme and plot theming across all blog posts with a single switch."

    "text": "The Solution\nAfter some tinkering, I came up with the following solution:\n\nI gathered a few themes into .csv files, where each row is a color, and columns give the color’s name, hex, and role.\nI slightly modified the Minty bootswatch theme to use variables which define the role of a color (e.g. background, text, primary, etc. color). Note that not every color in a theme needs a role.\nI created jinjar compatible template files for ggplot2 and Quarto; I don’t use a template file for Observable, instead colors are saved in a simple .json file.\nI wrote a build script which reads in the theme .csv files, builds the templates, and writes them to a directory where Quarto and any blog posts know to look for themes.\nI modified the site _quarto.yml to run the theme build script every time the website is rendered.\n\nNow any time I want to try a new theme, I just need to drop it into a .csv file, and make a small change to my theme building script! As a bonus, I also wrote a small script that takes the built ggplot2 template and creates a new themed favicon.\nI’d love to hear any suggested improvements, feel free to tweet me!"

    "text": "Using a Proper Prior\nTo set the stage, let’s suppose I am an avid runner, and I’d like to better understand how quickly my heart rate recovers after running a hard (for me) mile. The data from my runs might look something like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Table 1: Sample Heart Rate Data\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Day of Month\n      Mile Time (Seconds)\n      Recovery Heart Rate (Beats per Minute)\n    \n  \n  \n    1\n489\n165\n    5\n465\n169\n    7\n470\n177\n    18\n491\n175\n    27\n477\n180\n    30\n455\n167\n  \n  \n  \n    \n       Note: heart rate is measured one minute after a hard one mile effort.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nFor the sake of simplicity1, let us assume that my recovery heart rate is normally distributed, and that the variance is fixed to some known population value. Formally, let \\(\\mu\\) represent my heart rate, the quantity we’d like to estimate, and let \\(\\sigma^2\\) be the known variance. We’ll fix \\(\\sigma^2=12\\).\nIn a Bayesian framework, we assume that our data drawn from some distribution (normal, in this case) that is specified by some set of parameters (the unknown parameter \\(\\mu\\), and the known parameter \\(\\sigma^2\\)). Without looking at the data, we don’t know what \\(\\mu\\) should be, but we can specify a distribution of possible values. For this example we’ll hypothesize that \\(\\mu\\) is also normally distributed, \\(\\mu \\sim N(160, 20)\\) where the high variance expresses our uncertainty. This is our prior distribution.\nWith normally distributed data and a normal prior for \\(\\mu\\), we’ve specified a normal-normal model with known variance.\nOnce I’ve collected data, denoted by \\(Y\\), we can use Bayes’ theorem to update our estimate of \\(\\mu\\).\n\\[\nP(\\mu|Y) = \\frac{L(Y|\\mu)P(\\mu)}{P(Y)}.\n\\tag{1}\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(P(\\mu|Y)\\) is the distribution of possible values of \\(\\mu\\), now informed by data. This is what we’d like to estimate.\n\\(L(Y|\\mu)\\) is the likelihood of observing the data that was collected, given the true value of \\(\\mu\\).\n\\(P(\\mu)\\) is the prior distribution.\n\\(P(Y)\\) is the unconditional likelihood of observing the data. We will ignore this term, as it is constant once the data has been observed.\n\nIf we evaluate this, we end up with2:\n\\[\nP(\\mu|Y) \\propto N \\left(\n  \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{n}{12}} \\left( \\frac{160}{20} + \\overline Y \\frac{n}{12} \\right),\n  \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{n}{12}}\n  \\right).\n\\tag{2}\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(n\\) is the number of observations.\n\\(\\overline Y\\) is the mean observed recovery heart rate.\n\\(12\\) is the known population variance of recovery heart rate recordings.\n\\(160\\) is the prior mean recovery heart rate.\n\\(20\\) is the variance we’ve put on the prior.\n\nThis is our posterior distribution, the distribution of possible values for my recovery heart rate taking into account both the observed data and the prior.

It’s a best guess, when the reality is that we don’t really know what \\(\\mu\\) should be before observing any data. As a naive alternative, what would happen if we just set the prior probability of each possible value of \\(\\mu\\) to 1?\nWell it turns out that we can do exactly this - we can use any prior, even an improper prior as long as the posterior comes out to be a proper distribution. In other words, the prior need not be a proper distribution so long as the posterior is. In this particular case we end up with up with a posterior that is informed entirely by observed data.\n\nA proper distribution integrates to 1.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nP(\\mu|Y) &\\propto L(Y|\\mu)P(\\mu) \\\\\n         &\\propto L(Y|1)\\times1 \\\\\n         &\\propto L(Y)\n\\end{align*}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nChoosing an improper prior that generates a valid posterior can be tricky, but Jeffreys prior is a generally good place to start."
